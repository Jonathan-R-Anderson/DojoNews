## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- [astral/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DogukanUrker/flaskBlog.git
cd flaskBlog/app

# Run with uv
uv run app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:1283` in your browser.

### Docker Compose

Run the full stack with Docker:

```bash
# edit DOMAIN in .env if you want BunkerWeb to answer on a custom domain
docker compose up --build
```

The `gateway` service now listens on port `80` and decides whether to send
traffic to BunkerWeb or to an [annoying honeypot](https://github.com/feross/TheAnnoyingSite.com)
based on a simple user‚Äëagent check. BunkerWeb's management UI is still
available on port `8000`. The `DOMAIN` value defines which Host header
the stack accepts.

If you need to expose a running container on all host ports (except SSH on
port 22 and HTTP on port 80), use the `host_port_forward.sh` script on the
host:

```bash
sudo ./host_port_forward.sh <container_name>
```


### Blockchain

User accounts, posts, comments, tipping, sponsor slots and media magnets are now handled by dedicated contracts under [`contracts/`](contracts/). Each contract is owned by the sysop who deployed it, while public methods let authors create posts or comments and fans send tips. All smart-contract interactions are performed in the browser via `ethers.js`, keeping the Flask backend free of blockchain dependencies.

### Static Files via BitTorrent

All images in [`images/`](images/) are served normally by the Flask server but
are also seeded over BitTorrent for additional distribution. Magnet URLs for
the images are stored on-chain and fetched directly in the browser via the
PostStorage smart contract, then rendered using WebTorrent and Blob URLs for
load-balanced delivery.

### Default Admin Account
