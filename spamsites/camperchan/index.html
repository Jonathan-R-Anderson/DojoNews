On September 26, 2002, a body was discovered in the Greenbrier State Forest by a passerby. The body was over an embankment along Greenbrier State Forest Road (Harts Run).
The body has been examined and determined to be of Asian descent with a height between 4'2" and 5'2", the age is believed to be between 25 to 33. One article of clothing was Mercata brand orange shorts which are only sold in Walmart stores in Mexico. The person's teeth were all found to be original with a few fillings. It was determined that the individual was probably right-handed. A pair of green swimming goggles was also located near the body. A blue Ford Escort was seen in the area and may possibly be linked to the crime.
