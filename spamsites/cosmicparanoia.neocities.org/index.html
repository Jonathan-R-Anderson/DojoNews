<h1>Cosmic Paranoia</h1>

<p>We have all looked at the sky and wondered why it's blue. It's one of the most common questions asked by anyone with a scientific curiosity. However, did you ever wonder the sky is dark at night? Why is there such darkness in space?
We had great scientists use the nature's own language of mathematics to solve so much mysteries of space and time. But did anyone answer why? Why is it that the speed of light is limited while distances between cosmic objects so tremendous? Why is space so empty and dead? Why are the only pockets of life we know exisit on a single planet orbiting a single star?</p>

<p>One thing we must remember is that we are limited creatures. We seem to see only three spatial dimensions and just a single temporal dimension. Is there something beyond these dimensions? Is there something completely different out there, that is completely out of our sense of reality?</p>

<p>The stars hum with clandestine transmissions.</p>
