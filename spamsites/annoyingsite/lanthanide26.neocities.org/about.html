            <h1>About The Edison Clinic</h1>
            <br>
            <p2>Hello. This is less about us, more about you. We want everyone to be happy and healthy, and with health and happiness comes responsibility. But let's be real, who are we?</p2>
            
            <p3>We were founded in 19██ by ██████ █, he cared deeply for ████████████████████, whom he l████████████████████self. ████████████████████perience, and had ██████████. His ██████████, ██████████████████ horseriding and spent da████████████████████████████████████████ who she lovingly did not name after herself. The ██████████ happy until the final years when she developed Leptospirosis, leading to kidney failure in many horses- but not Tyra, who died of ████████████████████. Ronnie Wood, guitarist of the R██████████s also runs Sandym██████████ in Ireland and has enjoyed ██████████ for years with his family. When ████████ reached age ███████████ed that enough was enough, and started the Edison Clinic we now call salvation.</p3>
