While the Tiger Woods nonstory is being minutely followed, and while the oil spill is endlessly discussed, what is happening to the Euro and the Chinese economy, not to mention the wars in progress, are at best, back page items. Watch these things as they unfold and see if Evola‚Äôs analysis doesn‚Äôt move us to a higher level of understanding.

‚ÄúEvery time an effect outlasts and transcends its tangible causes, a suspicion should arise, and a positive or negative influence behind the stages should be perceived. A problem is posited, but in analysing it and seeking its solution, prudence must be exercised. The fact that those who have ventured in this direction have not restrained their wild imaginations has discredited what could have been a science, the results of which could hardly be overestimated. This too meets the expectations of the hidden enemy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter considering the state of society and modern civilization, one should ask if this is not a specific case that requires the application of this method; in other words, one should ask whether some situations of real crisis and radical subversion in the modern world can be satisfactorily explained through "natural" and spontaneous processes, or whether we need to refer to something that has been concerted, namely a still unfolding plan, devised by forces hiding in the shadows. Today more than ever it is necessary to refer to these perspectives, which should not be confused with mere speculations and which, besides having a value for knowledge, can supply weapons for the right course of action.‚Äù ‚Ä¶

THE OCCULT WAR IS REAL.

‚ÄúMethodologically speaking, we must be careful to prevent valid insights from degenerating into fantasies and superstition, and not develop the tendency to see an occult background everywhere and at all costs.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn this regard, every assumption we make must have the character of what are called "working hypotheses" in scientific research‚Äîas when something is admitted provisionally, thus allowing the gathering and arranging of a group of apparently isolated facts, only to confer on them a character not of hypothesis but of truth when, at the end of a serious inductive effort, the data converge in validating the original assumption.‚Äù

Yes, good readers, we have discovered a confluence of several streams of thought where metaphysics and historiography merge and flow together. If you are a spiritual person, you may (or may not) be troubled by all of this, or you could choose a different theological explanation.

I don’t trust people who are all things to all men. Jim Garrison is the same way. So is Mark Lane. The only thing I like about David is that he isn’t a hysteric. He carries it to greater extremes than I can relate to, though. Since he seems the only non-hysteric in conspiracy politics, though, he’s all I’ve got in that department. If he thinks Wilson is a Nietchian, though, he is a hysteric about that much. That’s 203 that Anglo-Saxon thing, again. Everybody is either a Communist a Capitalist or a Nazi – there are no anarchists in that worldview. Like the CFR scene in the Trilogy. The Anarchists are no different (to them) than the hordes of Ghengis Kahn. A nice weak, safe enemy for all the Powers to pick on, if you ask me. Like potheads and gays to the police. That’s speculation about where they are at, of course. I look at the results and I draw what seem like obvious conclusions. Non-Caucasians are being exterminated by famines by the millions, so I conclude the Nazis remain very powerful. Bolsheviks cooperate with this conspiracy of extermination so I conclude they are instruments of the German ruling class. The Invisible Hand of the technocracy leaves its fingerprints wherever there are Hitlers or Stalins or Castros, so I conclude they were all instruments of the same conspiracy. You find a big foot print, you assume a large man or woman walked there. You find a small foot print, you assume a small person left it. When, in the Marines, Ronald Wilson told the CO Ravenhurst was a huge, mountain of a man – and then they found size six shoes under his bunk, they began to suspect things. The fact is, vast areas in Africa are suffering famine. All anyone talks about is Ethiopia. Then they whip up a frenzy of charitable aid. Then the Marxist government confiscates food supplies. Rumors say the British have got the Marxist politicians there under surveillance and control. Eventually, no doubt, they will be overthrown by the Dutch who will introduce Carter capitalism and then the famine will end and everyone will be more convinced than ever that revolutionaries are cruel and incompetent. Eventually the old British and Dutch colonial empires will rule Africa again. There’ll be a few surviving Blacks, a few lions, a few zebras for the tourist trade. A lot of cheap raw materials in Europe. All because of what everyone was taught to call communism.
