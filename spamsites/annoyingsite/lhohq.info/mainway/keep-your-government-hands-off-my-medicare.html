<meta name="keywords" content="For a divine birth there is a divine period comprehended by a perfect number; for a human birth, but the first number in which root and square increases, comprising three distances and four limits, of elements that make like and unlike, and that wax and wane, render everything conversable and rational. Of these elements, the root four-three mated with five, thrice increased, produces two harmonies. One of them is of equal length in one way but is an oblong, one side, of one hundred rational diameters of five, lacking one for each, or if of irrational diameters, lacking two of each; one the other side, of one hundred cubes of three. This whole geometrical number is sovereign of better and worse begettings

To the man who pursues his studies in the proper way, all geometric constructions, all systems of numbers, all duly constituted melodic progressions, the single ordered scheme of all celestial revolutions, should disclose themselves, and disclose themselves they will, if, as I say, a man pursues his studies aright with his mind's eye fixed on their single end. As such a man reflects, he will receive the revelation of a single bond of natural interconnection between all these problems.

A wild, weird clime that lieth sublime<br>
Out of Space, Out of Time<br>
--- Edgar Allen Poe<p>

Information is no longer a staff function but an operational one. It is deadly as well as useful.<br>
--- Executive Summary, <em>Air Force 2025</em> report</p><p>


Reality has always been too small for human imagination.<br>
--- Brenda Laurel</p><p>

"...with electricity and automation, the technology of fragmented 
processes suddenly fused with the human dialogue and the need for 
over-all considerations of human unity. Men are suddenly nomadic 
gatherers of knowledge, nomadic as never before, informed as never 
before, free from fragmentary specialization as never before - but also 
involved in the total social process as never before, since with 
electricity we extend our central nervous system globally, instantly 
interrelating every human experience." <br>
--- Marshall McLuhan, in <em>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</em>, 1964</p><p>  <!--page 358-->


Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of 
legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught 
mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted 
from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable 
complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters 
and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding... <br>
--- William Gibson, in <em>Neuromancer</em>, 1984</p><p>

<a href="neuro-linguistic-meta-programming/ai-system/cryptome.org/cuw.html"><em>Unrestricted Warfare</em></a>, by Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui, Beijing: PLA Literature and Arts Publishing House, February 1999  [bold emphasis is ours]
   </p><ul>
   <li>"In terms of beyond-limits warfare, there is no longer any distinction between what is or is not the battlefield. <strong>Spaces in nature</strong> including the ground, the seas, the air, and outer space are battlefields, but <strong>social spaces</strong> such as the military, politics, economics, culture, and the psyche are also battlefields. And <strong>the
 technological space linking these two great spaces is even more so the 
battlefield over which all antagonists spare no effort in contending</strong>.
 [3] Warfare can be military, or it can be quasi-military, or it can be 
non-military. It can use violence, or it can be nonviolent. It can be a 
confrontation between professional soldiers, or one between newly 
emerging forces consisting primarily of ordinary people or experts. 
These characteristics of beyond-limits war are the watershed between it 
and traditional warfare, as well as the starting line for new types of 
warfare."

Chaos Philosophorum.
<p>
Filius Philosophorum audiat Sophos unanimiter concludentes Opus hoc esse Creationis Universi affilandum.
<p>
In initio igitur creavit DEUS Coelum et Terram, et erat Terra inanis et vacua, et ferebatur DEI Spiritus super aquarum faciem, and dixit DEUS: Esso Lux, et Lux erat.
<p>
Verba haec Artis filio sat erunt.  Etenim Coelum cum Terra oportet conjungi super thorum amicitie.  Sic in honore per universam vitam regnabit.
<p>
Terra est corpus grave, mineralium Matrix, quod in se illa occulte servet, licet arbores et animalia in lucem proferat.
<p>
Coelum est in quo Luminaria magna cum Astris circumvolvuntur, suaque vires trans aera ad inferiora dimittit, at in principio confusa simul omnia fecere Chaos.
<p>
Ecce sancte veritatem propalavi: Chaos etenim Nostrum est quasi Mineralis Terra, coagulationis suae repectu, et tamen aer volatilis, intra quod est Coelum Philosophorum in Centro suo, quod Centrum est revera Astrale, irradians Terram adusque superficiem suo jubare.
<p>
Et quis Magus tam prudens, qui ex hisce colligat novum Regem natum cunctis praepollentem, fratrum suorum a labe Originali Redemptorem, quem oporet mori, et in altum tolli ut carnem suam et sanguinem in mundi vitam det?
<p>
Bone Deus, quam mirifica sunt haec tua Opera?  A te hoc factum est et miraculum apparet in oculis nostris.

   <ul>
   <li>The Air Force's operational Cyberspace Command, also known as 8th
 Air Force, is commanded by Lt. Gen. Robert J. "Bob" Elder. He said as 
part of an effort to develop better understanding of the cyberspace 
domain, elements of the command recently engaged in mock battle with 
aggressors and tactical experts from the Air Warfare Center at Nellis 
Air Force Base, Nev. 
   </li><li>The <em>National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations</em>
 defines cyberspace as "domain characterized by the use of electronics 
and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange date via
 networked systems and associated physical infrastructures." 
   </li><li>The general said the Air Force has had to develop a more 
concrete idea of what it means to fly and fight in cyberspace. He said 
the command has been focusing on four key areas that help define its 
role as laid out in the Air Force's mission statement.
      <ul> 
   <li>"First, we must control the domain," he said. "This is about 
operational freedom of action. We have to be able to protect the 
electromagnetic spectrum we use to communicate with each other, for 
example. We have to protect the electronics that we use to establish 
that domain and we have to protect those networks. Conversely we want to
 have the capability to deny those things to our adversaries." 
   </li><li>Secondly, the Air Force will use cyberspace to integrate operations across the other warfighting domains. 
   </li><li>Thirdly, the Air Force will conduct offensive operations in cyberspace in much the same way as its adversaries. 
   </li><li>Finally, he said, the cyberspace will be used as an enabling
 operation to support its ability to do intelligence or influence 
operations." 
      </li></ul> 
   </li></ul>

</p></li><li><a href="http://www.lhohq.info/info-ops/usaf/cyberspace_taskforce_sep06.pdf">Cyberspace: A Warfighting Domain  (<font color="red">local copy</font>)</a>, briefing by Kass, 26 Sep 2006, HQ USAF, AF Cyberspace Task Force
<p>
</p></li><li>USAF <em>AIM Points</em>, 2 Nov 2006
   <ul>
   <li>"Secretary of the Air Force Michael W. Wynne announced today that
 the 8th Air Force is now the service's lead command for cyberspace. <p>
"The command's new responsibility is a potential step to becoming an Air
 Force major command. The move accompanies the service's ever-increasing
 reliance on operations within the cyberspace domain. </p><p>
"The 8th Air Force will be responsible for training, organizing and 
equipping the service for cyberspace operations and managing career 
planning to grow cyberspace professionals from among the active duty, 
guard, reserve, and civilian ranks.</p><p>
"In December 2005, the Air Force mission statement was amended to 
include cyberspace as an opera! tional domain along with air and space. 
The service stood up the Cyberspace Task Force in January, led by 
military strategist Dr. Lani Kass. The task force, composed of Airmen 
from across the Air Force, has spent the past ten months gathering data 
and exploring how the service operates effectively in cyberspace. </p><p>
"The traditional principles of war as taught to young officers apply 
fully in cyberspace, and cyberspace operations can include far more than
 computer network attack and defense. The use of improvised explosive 
devices in Iraq, terrorist use of Global Positioning Satellites and 
satellite communications, internet financial transactions by 
adversaries, radar and navigational jamming, and attacking American 
servers as just a few examples of operations that involve the cyberspace
 domain."

   <li>The Mercyhurst wiki, completed in the 10-weeks duration of the 
Strategic Analysis course, contains over 1,000 individual pages. It 
assesses the strategic impact of disease in almost every corner of the 
globe, employs a rigorous methodology to define both "U.S. National

Although the Mercyhurst "NIE" should not be construed as an official

approaches. The Mercyhurst experience was also an important lesson in

   <li>The Soldiers' indicated that working with a simulated three 
dimensional environment dramatically changed their approach to the 
mission. Conducting rehearsals within a low-fidelity simulation was 
considered an enhancement to the training value of field exercises. The 
gathered opinion-based information indicates that the system can prepare
 troops for more expensive live drills and actual deployment; 
integrating basic Warrior skills with reinforced situational awareness, 
decision making, and asymmetric warfare skills.

   <ul>
   <li>This paper explores what the state of virtual reality interface 
technology will be in the future by analyzing the current state of the 
art, forecasting trends in areas relevant to virtual reality interface 
research and development, and highlighting the barriers to providing 
virtual reality environments that are immersive and interactively 
indistinguishable from reality (strong VR). This research shows that the
 evolutionary pathway of virtual reality technology development will not
 be able to overcome all of the barriers and limitations inherent in the
 current generation of interfaces.
   </li><li>The US Air Force should continue to develop common VR 
interface technology using widely available interfaces, but should 
increase its funding and support for technologies that will enable 
enhanced brain-machine interfaces to ensure its dominance in training 
and simulation for the future.

<ul>
<li>From essays/papers from <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/2025/">Air Force 2025 project</a>
   <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.lhohq.info/2025/volume4/vol4ch02.pdf">\93...Or Go Down In Flame\94? An Airpower Manifesto for the 21st Century</a>
      <ul>
      <li>The second discontinuity involves the \93how\94 of military power in the enveloping onrush of information technology. Simply put, <em>being digital</em>,
 to use Nicholas Negroponte\92s meaning of the new ontology, means the 
high ground is no longer aerospace, in and of itself, but cyberspace. <strong>Understood
 in its broadest sense, cyberspace is the great confluence of all the 
various bits and information streams which, together, generate the 
strategic topsight prerequisite for victory.</strong>
<br>
By history, predilection, and structure, topsight is the natural (but 
not automatic) domain of the Air Force. But prior to staking its claim 
to tomorrow's high ground, the Air Force needs to redefine itself as an 
infospheric institution rather than an atmospheric one.
      </li><li>What then of the Air Force? Habituated to being the 
willful, rebellious little sibling of the Army, the Air Force found it 
difficult to change without clinging to the instrument that won it 
independence. Then came ballistic missiles and the shotgun wedding of 
aero and space. Will the even greater evolution to cyberspace\97it is 
really nothing more than that\97create a fuss, even though it is 
absolutely faithful to the vision of airpower's founders? Of course. The
 combat airman is the last and emotional vestige of knighthood, the 
product of the warriors\92 quest for one-on-one combat. We breed cranky 
individualism because we believe, when all is said and done, that 
warfare really is about LeMay being superior to
Khrushchev, or Horner being superior to Saddam.
      </li><li>The Air Force apex always will be defined as the masters 
of the medium, but in an infospheric Air Force, the medium of air can 
yield a bit to the various space media. The notion of the cyber-jock 
grappling with the dynamic exigencies of the metasystem in real time is 
not yet here; those who stare into the screen rarely have to react in 
real time with \93TekWar\94 tempo. Yet, as the metasystem becomes increasing
 integrated with sensors and weapons, such real-time control will become
 increasingly possible, and no one who has
spent any time with any masters of the game can doubt their acuity.

      <ul>
      <li>Global awareness in 2025 will require, additionally, detection
 and understanding in the inforealm or cyberspace. In the info-realm, 
global awareness must provide the information-in-war essential for 
information attack on the strategic, operational, or tactical centers of
 gravity of an adversary\92s military, political, social, and economic 
infrastructure.

      <ul>
      <li>The four possible media were defined to be air, space, 
cyberspace, and surface/subsurface; therefore, under the task detect, 
there are four subtasks: detect (things) in the air, detect in space, 
detect in cyberspace, and detect on the surface (and subsurface). This 
same logic applied to the engage, survive, deploy, maintain, and <em>replenish</em>
 tasks. Note that the medium is where the target (the thing being 
detected or engaged) is located, not where the system doing the 
detecting or engaging is located.
      </li><li><strong>In this paper, cyberspace is defined as \93the <em>virtual</em> [emphasis added] space of computer memory and networks, telecommunications, and digital media.\94</strong>
  Because cyberspace is a virtual space, there is no need to move or 
deploy. The Internet is a good example; being on-line means being 
engaged.  [definition in quotes is taken from <em>The Cyberspace Lexicon: An Illustrated Dictionary of Terms From Multimedia to Virtual Reality</em>, by Bob Cotton -(London: Phaedon, 1994]

   <li>Coordinated cyber attacks designed to shape the larger

 become the key feature of the next war. Early forms of this may have

   <ul>
   <li>War\92s true transformation has a face very different from the one 
originally envisioned by the Pentagon\92s civil and military leadership, 
in which the force with the more expensive cutting-edge equipment would 
prevail. Yet let there be no misguided enthusiasm: new means of 
communication neither \93annihilate space\94 nor disperse the fog of war; on
 the contrary, the web makes warfare even more chaotic, messy, and 
deadly. Just as the telegraph once did.
   </li><li>...ordinary users must be treated as co-developers who can 
come up with a new product or add a competitive edge to it, not merely 
as consumers. Tactical battle guidelines and lessons-learned essays 
benefit from user-developed suggestions and improvements in a way that 
is analogous to the \93patches\94 of open-source applications or Wikipedia\92s
 articles, called peer-production in the industry\92s jargon.
   </li><li>The information environment does not stay external to the 
organization any longer, neither for the U.S. Army nor for its enemies. 
It is flooding the hierarchy from the bottom up, and enabling new forms 
of networked organizations.

   <li>One of the consequences of the network revolution and 
corresponding distribution of authority is that many more persons up and
 down the ranks will be making combat decisions than compared to the 
days of centralized command and control. Power is migrating from 
headquarters \93to the edge.\94  Therefore, it is essential to foster

   <li>One of the central issues of 21st Century Informatics will be how
 to link, in theory and in practice, computational perception, 
representation, transformation and generation processes to external 
worlds. The external world may be the "real" world or another 
computational environment that has its own character. Examples of where 
this issue arises include bio-mimetic robotics, computer-based visual 
perception, dynamic control of the interaction of robotic systems with 
their environment or each other, computer-based generation of external 
phenomena, such as images, music or actions, and agent-based interaction
 with other agents or humans, as in computer games.

   <ul>
   <li>We are all unfortunately familiar with the inhumane torture and 
beheading of hostages being published to the world on the Internet by 
terrorists. Threats of terrorism likewise have been distributed to the 
world through the Internet. It is well known that al-Qaeda uses the  
Internet daily to plan attacks, communicate among cells, and recruit 
members. One recent news report cited a survey which found that 76% of 
the top 25 terrorist Websites are actually based on American computer 
systems, perhaps by use of proxy servers.<sup>2</sup> My purpose today 
is not to review specific ideas on how to keep the Internet from 
becoming a facilitator of terrorism. But I firmly believe that we all 
have a duty to do what we can to address this problem. All of our 
wonderful discussions about Internet creativity and profitability are 
insignificant if we cannot provide our citizens with basic security in 
their homes and workplaces.

      <li>The U.S. military's ability to predict, defend against and 
adapt to cyber-attack remain largely undeveloped, simplistic and 
reactive. The current state of Information Assurance (IA) has been 
described as "blind and powerless" (McCollum, 1999). In particular, 
knowledge is lacking about the methods and agents of attack, as well as 
the manner in which computer networks respond to attack. Information 
Extraction and Transport (IET) proposes a unique application of 
bio-scientific methodologies providing rigorous, repeatable, and 
quantifiable functionality to assess, monitor, and predict the behavior 
of attack agents and the health of computer networks.

   <li>The Golden Shield \97 the latest addition to what is widely 
referred to as the Great Firewall of China \97 was supposed to monitor, 
filter, and block sensitive online content. But only a year after 
completion, it already looks doomed to fail. True, surveillance remains 
widespread, and outspoken dissidents are punished harshly. But my 
experience as a correspondent in China for seven years suggests that the
 country's stranglehold on the communications of its citizens is 
slipping: Bloggers and other Web sources are rapidly supplanting 
Communist-controlled news outlets. Cyberprotests have managed to bring 
about an important constitutional change. And ordinary Chinese citizens 
can circumvent the Great Firewall and evade other forms of police 
observation with surprising ease. If they know how.

   <li>In the coming months, commentators around the world would look 
back at this moment and debate its significance. But for Aaviksoo, the 
meaning was clear. This was not the first botnet strike ever, nor was it
 the largest. But never before had an entire country been targeted on 
almost every digital front all at once, and never before had a 
government itself fought back. "The attacks were aimed at the essential 
electronic infrastructure of the Republic of Estonia," Aaviksoo tells me
 later. "All major commercial banks, telcos, media outlets, and name 
servers \97 the phone books of the Internet \97 felt the impact, and this

   <ul>
   <li>The five young men detained in Pakistan this week -- like a whole
 new generation of jihadis -- appear to have made considerable use of 
the Internet in their alleged approach to al Qaeda. Their story points 
out that, more than eight years after 9/11, terrorist networks are still
 not only able to stay in touch via cyberspace, but that they are even 
extending their reach thanks to our giving them a free ride in the 
virtual domain. 
   </li><li>Those who do try to keep an eye on terrorism in cyberspace 
often argue that they learn a lot about enemy networks by monitoring 
their narratives on jihadi websites. But if this made a real difference,
 we would have already won the war on terror. 
   </li><li>Instead of thinking of cyberspace principally as a place to 
gather intelligence, we need to elevate it to the status of 
"battlespace." This means that we either want to exploit terrorists' use
 of the Web and Net unbeknownst to them, or we want to drive them from 
it. 
   </li><li>But if wannabe jihadis are attracted to the 12th-century 
logic of al Qaeda, they still need 21st-century information technology 
to link up. The events in Sargodha, the other current case of David 
Headley in Chicago, and the earlier instance of Najibullah Zazi the 
Denver airport shuttle driver, all point to an emergent subculture -- 
one that is increasingly enabled by and dependent upon cyberspace.

   <li>The Internet has five characteristics that make it an ideal tool for terrorist organizations.

</p></li><li>"Mass-Media Theater," by Weimann, in State Department <em>eJournal USA</em>, May 2007
   <ul>
   <li>"When one says "terrorism" in a democratic society, one also says
 "media." For terrorism by its very nature is a psychological weapon 
which depends upon communicating a threat to a wider society. This, in 
essence, is why terrorism and the media enjoy a symbiotic relationship."
 \97Paul Wilkinson
   </li><li>It is clear that terrorists plan their actions with the 
media as a major consideration. They select targets, location, and 
timing according to media preferences, trying to satisfy criteria for 
newsworthiness, media timetables, and deadlines. They concoct and 
prepare visual aides\97such as film, video clips of attacks and forced 
"confessions" of hostages, taped interviews, and allegiance declarations
 of perpetrators of violence\97while also offering professional press and 
video news releases.
   </li><li>Terrorism and the Internet are related in two ways. First, 
the Internet has become a forum for both groups and individuals to 
spread messages of hate and violence and to communicate with one 
another, their supporters, and their sympathizers, while launching 
psychological warfare. Second, both individuals and groups have tried to
 attack computer networks in what has become known as cyber-terrorism or
 cyber-warfare. At this point, however, terrorists are using and 
benefiting from the Internet more than they are attacking it.

   <li>Abstract: Based on content analysis of global media and 
interviews with many diplomats and journalists, this paper describes the
 trajectory of the media from objective observer to fiery advocate, 
becoming in fact a weapon of modern warfare. The paper also shows how an
 open society, Israel, is victimized by its own openness and how a 
closed sect, Hezbollah, can retain almost total control of the daily

   <li>Terrorism is flourishing through terrorists\92 use of information 
and communication technologies (ICTs) in a globally connected world with
 over one billion online users and 233 countries connected to the 
Internet.  In part, this is due to (a) difficulties in tracking and 
tracing cyber communications, (b) the lack of globally-accepted 
processes and procedures for the investigation of cybercrimes, and (c) 
inadequate or ineffective information sharing systems between the public
 and private sectors.

   <ul>
   <li>...Mr. Ulph began the lecture by succinctly summarizing how the 
web has become a virtual Online University for radicalizing Muslims into
 Salafi-Jihadi ideology by offering what amounts to an in-depth "jihadi 
curriculum." He identified the methodical structure that jihadi websites
 present to sympathizers. These websites post up entire libraries of 
books and electronic pamphlets aimed at indoctrinating jihadi 
sympathizers and reassuring already indoctrinated jihadists of the 
legitimacy of their mission. Through this literature, an "armchair 
enthusiast" would begin his "cultural re-education" on the web with a 
discrediting of both the current Western and Islamic cultural orders. 
After realizing the fallacy of democracy and the illegitimacy of the 
present Islamic regimes, the new recruit is pointed in the direction of 
true Islam and called forth to perform the duty of jihad.

   <ul>
   <li>A recent discussion on http://tajdeed.org.uk demonstrates the 
increasingly common practice of training up-and-coming mujahideen via 
the internet. The postings attached archived copies of al-Ansar 
magazine, Sawt al-Jihad and Mu'askat al-Battar, all of which were 
clearinghouses for al-Qaeda's jihadi strategists. Such forum postings 
illustrate the way in which the community of mujahideen and their 
supporters not only develop and distribute curriculum for the aspiring, 
inexperienced youth who wish to join their ranks, but also consolidate 
jihadi strategy and serve as a conduit to implement that strategy at the
 lowest levels. The posting announced the "Encyclopedia of Periodicals 
and Publications on Jihad," containing dozens of files and links to 
magazines, mostly published in 2002-03. The author describes the project
 as a presentation and explanation of mujahideen communications being 
made available to all Muslims.

   <ul>
   <li>"Terrorist organizations and other national enemies have launched
 bogus Web sites that mask their covert information or provide 
misleading information to users they identify as federal employees or 
agents, according to Lance Cottrell, founder and chief scientist at 
Anonymizer of San Diego. 
   </li><li>"The criminal and terrorist organizations also increasingly 
are blocking all traffic from North America or from Internet Protocol 
addresses that point back to users who rely on the English language....
   </li><li>"Among the risks of the terrorist cloaking practice are that
 the organizations can provide bogus passwords to covert meetings. By 
doing so they can pinpoint federal intelligence agents who attend the 
meetings, making them vulnerable to being kidnapped or becoming the 
unwitting carriers of false information, Cottrell said.
   </li><li>"Another method Cottrell described was a case in which 
hackers set a number of criteria that they all shared using the Linux 
operating system and the Netscape browser, among other factors. When 
federal investigators using PCs running Windows and using Internet 
Explorer visited the hackers' shared site, the hackers' system 
immediately mounted a distributed denial-of-service attack against the 
federal system

<p>
   </p><ul>
   <li>Evidence strongly suggests that terrorists used the Internet to plan their operations for 9/11. <ul>Computers
 seized in Afghanistan reportedly revealed that al Qaeda was collecting 
intelligence on targets and sending encrypted messages via the Internet.
 As recently as 16 September 2002, al Qaeda cells operating in America 
reportedly were using Internet-based phone services to communicate with 
cells overseas. These incidents indicate that the Internet is being used
 as a \93cyberplanning\94 tool for terrorists. It provides terrorists with 
anonymity, command and control resources, and a host of other measures 
to coordinate and integrate attack options. </ul>
   </li><li><em>The Internet can be used to put together profiles</em>. <ul>Internet
 user demographics allow terrorists to target users with sympathy toward
 a cause or issue, and to solicit donations if the right \93profile\94 is 
found. </ul>
   </li><li><em>Internet access can be controlled or its use directed 
according to the server configuration, thus creating a true ideological 
weapon.</em><ul> ... The web allows an uncensored and unfiltered version
 of events to be broadcast worldwide. Chat rooms, websites, and bulletin
 boards are largely uncontrolled, with few filters in place.</ul>
   </li><li><em>The Internet can be used anonymously, or as a shell game to hide identities.</em> <ul>...
 Speech compression technology allows users to convert a computer into a
 secure phone device. ... An al Qaeda laptop found in Afghanistan had 
linked with the French Anonymous Society on several occasions. The site 
offers a two-volume Sabotage Handbook online.</ul>
   </li><li><em>The Internet produces an atmosphere of virtual fear or virtual life</em>.<ul>
 People are afraid of things that are invisible and things they don\92t 
understand. The virtual threat of computer attacks appears to be one of 
those things. Cyber-fear is generated by the fact that what a computer 
attack <em>could</em> do (bring down airliners, ruin critical 
infrastructure, destroy the stock market, reveal Pentagon planning 
secrets, etc.) is too often associated with what <em>will</em> happen.</ul>
   </li><li><em>The Internet can help a poorly funded group to raise money.</em>
   </li><li><em>The Internet is an outstanding command and control mechanism.</em>
   </li><li><em>The Internet is a recruiting tool.</em>
   </li><li><em>The Internet is used to gather information on potential targets.</em>
   </li><li><em>The Internet puts distance between those planning the attack and their targets.</em>
   </li><li><em>The Internet can be used to steal information or manipulate data.</em>
   </li><li><em>The Internet can be used to send hidden messages.</em>
   </li><li><em>The Internet allows groups with few resources to offset even some huge propaganda machines in advanced countries.</em>
   </li><li><em>The Internet can be used to disrupt business.</em>
   </li><li><em>The Internet can mobilize a group or diaspora, or other hackers to action.</em>
   </li><li><em>The Internet takes advantage of legal norms.</em>

   <ul>
   <li>Mobile agents are autonomous software entities that can halt 
themselves, ship themselves to another agent-enabled host on the 
network, and continue execution, deciding where to go and what to do 
along the way. Mobile agents are goal-oriented, can communicate with 
other agents, and can continue to operate even after the machine that 
launched them has been removed from the network. The mobile agent 
computing paradigm raises several privacy and security concerns, which 
clearly are one of the main obstacles to the widespread use and 
adaptation of this new technology. Mobile agents applications are 
currently being developed by industry, government, and academia for use 
in such areas as telecommunications systems, personal digital 
assistants, information management, on-line auctions, service brokering,
 contract negotiation, air traffic control, parallel processing, and 
computer simulation. Mobile agent security issues include: 
authentication, identification, secure messaging, certification, trusted
 third parties, non-repudiation, and resource control. Mobile agent 
frameworks must be able to counter new threats as agent hosts must be 
protected from malicious agents, agents must be protected from malicious
 hosts, and agents must be protected from malicious agents. This project
 is directed towards evaluating existing mobile agent security 
mechanisms and developing new countermeasures for mobile agent security 
threats. 
   </li><li>A number of advantages of using mobile code and mobile agent
 computing paradigms have been proposed. These advantages include: 
overcoming network latency, reducing network load, executing 
asynchronously and autonomously, adapting dynamically, operating in 
heterogeneous environments, and having robust and fault-tolerant 
behavior.

   <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The objective of this effort is to 
develop a defensive \93Cyber-Craft\94 for full-spectrum computer network 
defense and information assurance.
   </li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Today\92s philosophy of cyber 
defense is centered on strong boundary protection (e.g. firewalls) and 
network intrusion detection systems. While these technologies provide 
some sound defensive capabilities, if breached these types of systems 
provide the intruder with full-access to an enterprise network. In a 
Network-Centric Warfare environment today's defenses will not scale to 
provide the protection required. We envision a new capability we call 
the cyber-craft that operates solely within the cyber domain to extend 
the arm of existing cyber defense and computer network defense 
capabilities. A cyber-craft can be thought of as a lightweight software 
agent system that performs multiple computer network defense and 
information assurance functions. The characteristics of a cyber-craft 
include the ability to be launched from a network platform, the ability 
to embed control instructions within the craft, the ability to 
positively control the cyber-craft from a remote network location or 
management console, the capability for the craft to self-destruct if 
attacked and corrupted, the capability for the cyber-craft to operate 
with minimal or no signature/footprint, and the ability for the 
cyber-craft to rendezvous and cooperate with other friendly cyber-craft.
 Small, lightweight cyber-craft agents could monitor a large enterprise 
network with nearly no performance degradation and cooperate in such a 
way that collectively they become a smart cyber sensor grid. It is 
envisioned that a cyber-craft system would augment existing computer 
network defenses by helping to perform security management, network 
management, intrusion detection, malware detection and eradication, and 
digital evidence gathering.

   <ul>
   <li>Coordinated cyber attacks designed to shape the larger 
battlespace and influence a wide range of forces and levers of power may
 become the key feature of the next war. Early forms of this may have 
already been seen in Estonia and Georgia. Control of cyberspace may thus
 be as decisive in the network-dependent early 21st century as control 
of the air was for most of the 20th century.

   <ul>
   <li>Future wars are likely to be carried out, in part or perhaps 
entirely, in cyberspace. It might therefore seem obvious that 
maneuvering in cyberspace is like maneuvering in other media, but 
nothing would be more misleading. Cyberspace has its own laws; for 
instance, it is easy to hide identities and difficult to predict or even
 understand battle damage, and attacks deplete themselves quickly. 
Cyberwar is nothing so much as the manipulation of ambiguity. The author
 explores these in detail and uses the results to address such issues as
 the pros and cons of counterattack, the value of deterrence and 
vigilance, and other actions the United States and the U.S. Air Force 
can take to protect itself in the face of deliberate cyberattack.

      <li>In its sixth year, the CDX is about helping future protectors 
of military networks -- students in the nation's military academies -- 
learn more about what they will be faced with when they get out of 
school. 
      </li><li>As part of the CDX, participants were divided into three cells:<br>

-- Blue Cell participants included students of computer science and 
related fields at the nation's military service academies. Their role 
was to defend the military network.<br>

-- Red Cell participants played the aggressors. They came from the 
National Security Agency and various service network security groups 
such as the Air Force Information Warfare Center, the Navy Information 
Operations Command and the Marine Corps Network Operations and Security 
Command.<br>

-- White Cell participants, also seasoned network professionals, acted as exercise proctors, referees and scorekeepers. <br>

The exercise, like many military exercises, involved a hypothetical 
scenario. During the CDX, Blue Cell members played as if they were 
"deployed" to a South American country and were participating in 
counterterrorism efforts. While there, they defended a network built 
using both U.S. military and host nation equipment.

   <ul>
   <li>Abstract. The design of the defenses Internet systems can deploy 
against attack, especially adaptive and resilient defenses, must start 
from a realistic model of the threat. This requires an assessment of the
 capabilities of the adversary. The design typically evolves through a 
process of simulating both the system and the adversary. This requires 
the design and implementation of a simulated adversary based on the 
capability assessment. Consensus on the capabilities of a suitable 
adversary is not evident.  Part of the recent redesign of the protocol 
used by peers in the LOCKSS digital preservation system included a 
conservative assessment of the adversary's capabilities. We present our 
assessment and the implications we drew from it as a step towards a 
reusable adversary specification.
