handles are applied in setting cell properties, controlling execution, modifying
synaptic interconnections, etc. Properties of each cell within the neuromorphic
assembly (i.e. learning rate, neural plasticity, synaptic interconnections, memory
decay, etc) may be adjusted individually.
The HNeT library facilitates the integration of neuron cells into both simple and
highly elaborate neuromorphic assembly structures. The HNeT library permits
allocation of up to 64K assemblies per program instance. The HNeT library
provides integration of the seven primary neuron cell types listed below:
Principle Cell Types
Receptor
Granule
Pyramidal
Stellate
Purkinje
Hippocampal (temporal)
Axonal and collateral signal routing
Cell Morphology
The primary assembly structures provided within the HNeT system are illustrated
below for the cerebellar and neo-cortical models. The HNeT library provides an
array of functions for customization of individual cell architectures, cell assembly
architectures, synaptic interconnectivity, neural plasticity (synaptic pruning and
regrowth), customization of supervised, unsupervised, spatial-temporal and
hyper-incursive neural models, data conversion and preprocessing. A function
reference sheet for the HNeT API language is available upon request.



Principle Assembly Structures
Cerebellar Model
Cerebellar
Neo-cortical
Spatial-tem
Recursive
Hyper incursive
Composite (mixed)
Neo-Cortical Model
HNeT technology provides an exceptionally high "connection per second" or CPS
rating; in excess of 200 Million CPS on Pentium IV processors. This allows the
system to learn and/or respond to several millions of input patterns per second.
Advanced features of neural plasticity are provided. Neural plasticity allows the
HNeT system to optimize and reconfigure cell assembly structures and synaptic
interconnections in an automated manner.
An extensive library of conversion formats are provided for orthogonalization of
input data streams, including histogram normalization, Fourier, Gabor and wavelet
transforms. Custom algorithms may be integrated as post-processing transforms
within HNeT cells.
Permits dynamic (on line) modification of virtually all cell properties such as
synaptic and axonal interconnection, neural plasticity, cortical memory, learning
rate, execution sequence, etc.
