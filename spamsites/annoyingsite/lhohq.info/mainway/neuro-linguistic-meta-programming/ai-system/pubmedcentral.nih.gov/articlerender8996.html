 and Michael also. We went to an eviction party. I went back to the pub and explained to Yippies why I think Prussians are the problem with Russia – and everybody else, practically. Then I went on strike against thinking about politics. The party looked like it was going to be boring. They wanted to discuss Tony Jackson and CBS and Fire and Puritanism – defensively I wasn’t in the mood. They shouldn’ta given me LSD-25 if they wanted me to think about government. So I sat in the pub and watched Allen and Shelly and a gnomic teenager and a laughing Nigerian exchange student look beautifully esthetic – if that isn’t redundant. Yesterday when I woke up I not only was still mildly tripping, I also had a hangover from free beers Nat and Shelly and Allen bought me. Very unusual. I took an Excedrin, smoked a roach, then a joint – and the rest of the day was even 219 more unusually nirvanic. It rained and that was nice and psychedelic of the Weather Conspiracy – because this morning it has added to the pleasant acidy illusion that the world had just been to a car wash. I keep thinking, whenever I think about Woody Guthrie, about how “KILL FASCISTS” was emblazoned on his guitar. How times change. What rock singer of the Sixties would’ve written KILL anything on an instrument. That, I guess, was the function of the rock group, The Who. There was hypocrisy going down. More and more I feel like I should tremble as I write and speak. I make the most casual jokes and the whole world seems to go into upheaval. Of course worrying about it also seems ridiculous. Randall Carlson is an archival man; his vast dining room is converted into a library of magick and science and assassination history – an extension of his mind, which seems saturated with like information, both known and unknown. I slept in the house in his backyard last night – Monday night – with his permission, after first discussing the astrological conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter at the time of both John Kennedy’s and John Lennon’s assassinations. Similar tragedies have clouded history every 20 years when that conjunction occurs: in 1940 Franklin Delano Roosevelt became President. That is what Randall said. Now that I think of it, FDR was President all through the Thirties. I’ll have to mention that to him. FDR didn’t get us out of the Depression until getting us into the War. And his War Administration began after his 1940 re-election so maybe that’s it. These things become more and more manifest the harder you look. Anyway, the Saturn, Jupiter conjunction is supposed to symbolize the death of the old king and the ascension of the new king. The Satanists (I almost said Catholics) think I'm interested in starvation as a sneaky way of fighting mind control. I've been fanatical about starvation since 1959. I've only known I'm a mind control victim since 1979.

He himself trained the men in his immediate locality, and he also had
the organization throughout the country trained, but without guns. The
use of guns would not have been permitted except to regular authorized
militia. The drilling was done with wooden guns, each man hewing out a
stick to the size and shape of a modern rifle. At his home, carefully
concealed, each man had his rifle.

And then came the election. Troops were at the polls and a free ballot
was denied. It was the last straw. Citizens gathering after nightfall in
order to protest were told to disperse immediately, and upon refusal,
were fired upon. The next morning showed a death roll in the large
centers of population that was appalling.

Wisconsin was the state in which there was the largest percentage of the
citizenship unfavorable to the administration and to the interests.
Iowa, Minnesota and Nebraska were closely following.

Philip concluded to make his stand in the West, and he therefore ordered
the men in every organization east of the Mississippi to foregather at
once at Madison, and to report to him there. He was in constant touch
with those Governors who were in sympathy with the progressive or
insurgent cause, and he wired the Governor of Wisconsin, in cipher,
informing him of his intentions.

As yet travel had not been seriously interrupted, though business was
largely at a standstill, and there was an ominous quiet over the land.
The opposition misinterpreted this, and thought that the people had been
frightened by the unexpected show of force. Philip knew differently, and
he also knew that civil war had begun. He communicated his plans to no
one, but he had the campaign well laid out. It was his intention to
concentrate in Wisconsin as large a force as could be gotten from his
followers east and south of that state, and to concentrate again near
Des Moines every man west
