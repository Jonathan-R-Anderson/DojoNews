		IV. [deletion] Fund.
		
		[one line deleted] has been actively engaged in a campaign to raise funds for the purpose of erecting a new clinical research wing on the existing [deletion] The research wing will consist of a building six stories high, 320 feet long and 50 feet wide. Two-thirds of the space will be research laboratories and offices while 100 research beds will occupy the remainder. [deletion] participation in the fund-raising campaign outlined below will result in his having control of one-sixth of the total space in addition to the base-

		ment and general out-patient facilities. In this effort, [deletion] has secured the enthusiastic support of the medical faculty and the officers of the University who have carried the preliminary arrangements forward to the maximum extent of their resources.
		
		
		V. Financial Situation.
		
		The University will require about $3,000,000 for the [deletion] story addition. This sum is exclusive of the cost of land and the heating and power supply, which are already available at the site. At the present time under Public Law 221, funds are available to match funds raised by the University. The University has allocated $1,000,000 to this project and will assume upkeep and staffing obligations. [deletion] has agreed that if CIA will provide [deletion] a grant of $125,000, [deletion] will match this amount and make a total donation of $250,000 to the University Building Fund. This Agency's contribution will be made under the condition that it will be refunded if construction does not take place.

(U) Project Description
(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The Owning the Net (OTN) Project
provides the technological means for NSA/CSS to gain access to and
securely return high value target communications. By concentrating on
the means of communication, the network itself, and network links
rather than end systems, OTN research manipulates equipment
hardware and software to control an adversary's network. Research is
conducted at the Laboratory for Telecommunications Sciences in
College Park, MD, and supports the evolving NSA/CSS internal
information infrastructure and the larger IC.{...}

• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Continue research of quantum
communications technology to support the development of novel
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) attacks and assess the security
of new QKD system designs.

But all such propositions, since they cannot be tested, remain strictly meaningless according to the rules of the science game. A scientifically meaningful generalization deals with events that can be observed by humans, even if it requires special instruments to observe them. Things that can never be observationally detected even in principle, do not have any scientific meaning. What of things that can be observed in principle someday, but cannot be observed today? That is, what of statements like "There is a planet with humanoid intelligences in the system of the double star Sirius"? This is not scientifically meaningful today, but it is not meaningless either, since we can in principle visit Sirius in the future and investigate the matter. The modern tendency in science is to class such propositions, not yet meaningful but not forever meaningless, as \indeterminate\ statements. Only those statements which even in principle can never be tested are considered totally meaningless -such as our examples of bread that appears to be bread but isn't \essentially\ bread, or round squares, or colorless green ideas, or indwelling "natures." Some claim -indeed Samuel Edward Konkin III claimed in his footnotes to my original article on this subject -that there are scientific propositions that are not instrumental or observational in this sense. Specifically, Konkin cites the propositions or praxeology, such as "Causality exists." This, however, should be considered a proposition in philosophy, not in science; and the main stream of modern science regards praxeology as being as meaningless as theology. Amusingly, the very word "praxeology" comes from \praxis\, which in Latin designated the 15 \customary\ way of doing things, i.e., the tribal game-rules. The search for causality once was a rule of the science game, in early times, when it was thought that scientific generalizations must be stated as cause-and-effect mechanisms; but we know now that science can function with or without the causality rule. Some models are stated in causal language, and some are not, and that is al
