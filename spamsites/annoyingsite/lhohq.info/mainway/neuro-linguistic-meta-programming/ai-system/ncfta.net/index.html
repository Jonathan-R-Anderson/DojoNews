HNeT technology provides an exceptionally high "connection per second" or CPS
rating; in excess of 200 Million CPS on Pentium IV processors. This allows the
system to learn and/or respond to several millions of input patterns per second.
Advanced features of neural plasticity are provided. Neural plasticity allows the
HNeT system to optimize and reconfigure cell assembly structures and synaptic
interconnections in an automated manner.
An extensive library of conversion formats are provided for orthogonalization of
input data streams, including histogram normalization, Fourier, Gabor and wavelet
transforms. Custom algorithms may be integrated as post-processing transforms
within HNeT cells.
Permits dynamic (on line) modification of virtually all cell properties such as
synaptic and axonal interconnection, neural plasticity, cortical memory, learning
rate, execution sequence, etc.

security priorities. This budget represents a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 2.4 percent, below the FY 2012 enacted
level; and it reduces personnel by 1,241 positions, or one percent. The request meets the fiscal demands laid out
in the Budget Control Act by setting the IC on a path to reduce expenditures by $25 billion for ten years; with
over $15 billion of that amount saved by FY 2017.
(U) Developing a Balanced Intelligence Budget
(S) The IC leadership worked as a corporate body to develop the budget. The team first drew on lessons learned
from the drawdown in the 1990s, which left the IC with a distorted workforce that lacked sufficient mid-career
personnel and technical expertise. As a result of that drawdown, the IC reverted to extraordinary measures to
rebuild and balance the workforce. Moreover, we deferred infrastructure recapitalization, resulting in obsolete
facilities, single point failures, and inadequate power, space, and cooling. We also delayed investment, reducing
our ability to keep pace with technical advances to meet mission needs.
(U) Second, we looked forward to determine how best to meet increasing mission requirements over the next
decade in a resource-constrained environment. The IC leadership weighed the relative merit of capabilities and
looked at dependencies across the components. In addition, we coordinated closely with the Defense and domestic
departments to minimize disconnects and ensure balance.
(S) At the outset, I determined that we would not take a proportional reduction from each IC program, but
rather compare relative merits of programs. We carefully weighed cost and risk to understand both the short
and long term impact of our actions. To maximize investments for the future, we focused reductions on lower
priority capabilities; sought efficiencies and smarter ways to do business; and prudently accepted risk. Overall,
this budget is guided by the imperative to achieve the right balance against competing demands. Our guiding
principles were to:
