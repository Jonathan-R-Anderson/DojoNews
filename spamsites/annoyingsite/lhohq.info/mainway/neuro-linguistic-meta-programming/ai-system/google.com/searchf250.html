n allover your body, and it is very relaxing....very relaxing....and now you hear the sound of a very beautiful bird call.. .. And, of course, if the hypnosis works, you \do\ hear the bird call. Similarly, the Natural Law theorist (or any other metaphysician) tells you about abstractions with capital letters, 6 and he talks about these marvelously transcendental entities, and he talks, and he talks....and if the hypnosis works, the abstractions suddenly seem as "real" as, \or even more "real" than\, a ham sandwich and a cup of coffee. The process of going away from the sensory-sensual experience into verbally-induced fantasy works the same way in both forms of hypnosis, as we shall see. THE WRATH OF ROTHBARD \Truth! Truth! Truth! crieth the Lord of the Abyss of Hallucinations\ --Aleister Crowley, \The Book of Lies\ In \New Libertarian\, Vol. 4, No. 13, Prof. Murray Rothbard published an article called "On the Duty of Natural Outlaws to Shut Up." In it, Rothbard "replied" to Rollins's \The Myth of Natural Rights\, more or less, although he did not answer any of the very telling criticisms Rollins had leveled against his (Rothbard's) claim that some sort of metaphysical entity called a "right" resides in a human being like a "ghost" residing in a haunted house. Nevertheless, Rothbard's article seemed to me a very forceful polemic and had the same emotional power, and indeed the same logical structure, as a marvelous sentence attributed to Ring Lardner: \"Shut up," he explained.\ The persuasiveness of such "explanations" can be considerable, especially if they are delivered in a loud voice and accompanied by a threatening gesture with a baseball bat. In Rothbard's article, however, they are accompanied only by the literary equivalent of such noise and threat, i.e., by what semanticists call "snarl words" -words which express mammalian rage but do not contain information. It seems part of our glorious primate heritage that such noise and threat is often mistaken for argument, even though it should more properly becalled quarrel. Politicians, advertisers and, above all, the rev. clergy have been very industrious in spreading the notion that there is no difference between noise and information and that the loud noise is itself informative.
