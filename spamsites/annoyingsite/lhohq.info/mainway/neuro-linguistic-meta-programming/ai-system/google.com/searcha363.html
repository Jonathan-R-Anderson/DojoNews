ly taken on a more positive form with the deployment of phase II of MONUC.

Stressing the need to take steps for the deployment of phase III, he said it was essential to promote the energy and dynamism of the Lusaka process.  Mali
reserved its right to state its views on the Panel's recommendations, and supported the extension of its mandate.

He condemned last week’s killing of six humanitarian workers at Bunia in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Council President, Mr. CUNNINGHAM (United States), then suspended the meeting until 3 p.m.

WANG YINGFAN (China) welcomed the presence of the Ministers from Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi at the Council’s open meeting, adding that the report of the Panel and the work of the Council could help to stop the looting of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which had become truly rampant.  It was closely related to the continuation of the conflict, and the Council must take the measures to stop it.  Therefore, he endorsed the extension of the mandate of the Panel for an appropriate period of time.

He went on to say, however, that the report had caused serious repercussions in the region, and he believed that there was room for improvement.  For example, in the document, it was hard to distinguish between cases of reliable evidence and hearsay.  Stricter standards should be applied, and conclusions must be based on hard evidence.  Also, linking all exports with the exploitation of natural resources was stretching the facts. 

The conflict involved complicated questions such as disarmament, national reconciliation and the security concerns of the Democratic Republic and the neighbouring States, he said.  Many of those problems were interwoven, and joint efforts were needed to resolve the situation and implement the Lusaka agreement, translating into action the commitments made under it.  In the final analysis, it was necessary to reconcile of all groups involved.  Peace and stability in the ###about Stop buying these products on until Digital <a

responsive to the will of the people than that of almost any of the
civilized nations. Our Constitution and our laws served us well for the
first hundred years of our existence, but under the conditions of to-day
they are not only obsolete, but even grotesque. It is nearly
impossible for the desires of our people to find expression into law.
In the latter part of the last century many will remember that an
income tax was wanted. After many vicissitudes, a measure embodying
that idea was passed by both Houses of Congress and was signed by the
Executive. But that did not give to us an income tax. The Supreme Court
found the law unconstitutional, and we have been vainly struggling since
to obtain relief.

"If a well-defined majority of the people of England, of France, of
Italy or of Germany had wanted such a law they could have gotten it with
reasonable celerity. Our House of Representatives is supposed to be our
popular law-making body, and yet its members do not convene until a year
and one month from the time they are elected. No matter how pressing the
issue upon which a majority of them are chosen, more than a year must
elapse before they may begin their endeavors to carry out the will of
the people. When a bill covering the question at issue is finally
introduced in the House, it is referred to a committee, and that body
may hold it at its pleasure.

"If, in the end, the House should pass the bill, that probably becomes
the end of it, for the Senate may kill it.

"If the measure passes the Senate it is only after it has again been
referred to a committee and then back to a conference committee of both
Senate and House, and returned to each for final passage.

"When all this is accomplished at a single session, it is unusually
expeditious, for measures, no matter how important, are often carried
over for another year.

"If it should at last pass both House and Senate there is the Executive
veto to be considered. If, however, the President signs the bill and it
becomes a law, it is perhaps but short-lived, for the Supreme Court is
ever present with its Damoclean sword.

"These barriers and interminable delays have caused the demand
