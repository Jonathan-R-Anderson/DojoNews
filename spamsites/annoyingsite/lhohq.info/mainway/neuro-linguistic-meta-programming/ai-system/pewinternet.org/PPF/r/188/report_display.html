INTRODUCTION
1.
Pursuant to the fundamental philosophy of the American constitutional form of
government, it is the public policy of the United States to foster democracy and allow any person
to obtain copies of the records of agencies for any public or private purpose consistent with the
terms of the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552.
PARTIES
2.
The Plaintiff in this case is PATRICK EDDINGTON. EDDINGTON is a Policy
Analyst in Homeland Security and Civil Liberties at the Cato Institute.
EDDINGTONCase 1:17-cv-00128-GK Document 1 Filed 01/19/17 Page 2 of 7

community oversight.
3.

U.S.C. § 552.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
4.
This case is brought under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and presents a federal question
conferring jurisdiction on this Court.
5.

bring suit in the District of Columbia.
THINTHREAD AND TRAILBLAZER

phone and email communications and process it all as it was gathered, which was revolutionary
at the time.
7.
In order to protect the privacy rights of American citizens, protections were built
into ThinThread to anonymize and encrypt all collected data on Americans. In the event that a
link between a foreign power or agent of a foreign power (as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 1801, as
amended) and a U.S. Person was detected, the communications of the U.S. Person in question
could be decrypted pursua
