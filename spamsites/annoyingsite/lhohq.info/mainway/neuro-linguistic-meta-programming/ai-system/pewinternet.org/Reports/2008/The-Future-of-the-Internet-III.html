and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. The duress has not terminated and the
fear has not subsided. The duress is an element of or inherent in the underlying causes of action
complained of herein. The duress and coercion exerted by Defendants has been such as to have
actually deprived Plaintiff of her freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time, and it rose to
such a level that a person of reasonable firmness in Plaintiff's situation would have been unable
to resist. Exhs. A and B.
23.

Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man

and indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed,
Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear
like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with
Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was
capable of having her whole family killed. Exhs. A and B.
24.

The duress had prevented Plaintiff from starting litigation before this year.

However, as soon as she surfaced, she received threats. More specifically, shortly after her first
complaint was filed in California on April 26, 2016, she started receiving threatening phone calls
on her cell phone. Exh. A.
25.

Defendants are equitably estopped from arguing that any statute of limitations has

not been tolled as Defendants wrongfully forced Plaintiff to refrain from timely commencing this
action by threats, duress, and other misconduct. Exhs. A and B. Zimmerman v. Poly Prep
Country Day School, ___ F.Supp.2d ___ (2012), 2012 WL 3683393; General Stencils, Inc. v.
Chippa, 18 N.Y.2d 125, 127 (1966)(“a wrongdoer should not be able to take refuge behind the
shield of his own wrongdoing.”).
