The National Security Archive was founded in 1985 by a group of journalists and scholars who had obtained documentation under the FOIA and sought a centralized repository for these materials. Over the past twelve years, the Archive has become the world's largest non-governmental library of declassified documents.

This is the inventory list of donated materials in the National Security Archive's collection, from John Marks' FOIA request results which he used to do research for his book The Search For The Manchurian Candidate: The CIA and Mind Control, The Secret History of the Behavioral Sciences. (1979) W. W. Norton, published as Norton paperback in 1991, ISBN 0-393-30794-8).
