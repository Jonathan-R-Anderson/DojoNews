accused of complicity in the crime.  Licio Gelli, the ex-grandmaster of the

While the Director's statutory authority to expend funds for confidential purposes is not limited by law, we believe that a gift of Government funds as such would exceed the intent of the Congress in granting that power. However, where a gift is made for the express purpose of producing something of value to this Agency which cannot otherwise be obtained and there is reasonable expectation that the value may be received, the gift may in effect be an expenditure for proper official purposes.

There seems to be no question that those ends would be advantageous, so the main questions appear to be whether they could not be attained by more direct, normal methods, and, if not, whether the return is necessary and reasonable in relation to the donation.

We do not comment, therefore, on the value received if the project results in the benefits foreseen . We feel we should comment on factors affecting the probability of achieving those ends. In a legal sense, there is little or no control. Once the funds are donated, the individual, his foundation, or the hospital could conceivably refuse to work for us or allow us the use of the facilities.

He said that any specific measures by the Council should follow consideration of the expected addendum to the report, which the Panel was being asked to submit before the expiration of its mandate.  The Panel was expected to respond to the comments of those cited in the report, update its data and complete unfinished tasks in the remaining areas of investigation.  Appropriate Council action could only follow conclusive evidence and after the parties responsible for illegal activities failed to take corrective measures or comply with the Council's demands.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo should have full sovereignty over its natural resources, and exploitation, illegal or otherwise, by outside actors sho
