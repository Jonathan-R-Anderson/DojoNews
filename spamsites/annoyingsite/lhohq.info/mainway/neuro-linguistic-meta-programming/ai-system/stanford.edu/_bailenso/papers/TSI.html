from members of the House or elsewhere, other than from the Courts or
Senates, and such Cabinet Officers shall by reason thereof, be ex-officio
members of the House.

(b) Such officials are to hold their positions at the pleasure of the
Executive and the Executive is to hold his at the pleasure of the
majority of the House.

(c) In an address to the House, the Executive shall, within a reasonable
time after his selection, outline his policy of Government, both
domestic and foreign.

(d) He and his Cabinet may frame bills covering the suggestions made in
his address, or any subsequent address that he may think proper to make,
and introduce and defend them in the House. Measures introduced by the
Executive or members of his Cabinet are not to be referred to
committees, but are to be considered by the House as a whole, and their
consideration shall have preference over measures introduced by other
members.

elected for life, by direct vote of the people, and shall be subject to
recall by a majority vote of the electors of his State at the end of any
five-year period of his term. [Footnote: The reason for using the recall
here is that the term is lengthened to life and it seemed best to give
the people a right to pass upon their Senators at stated periods.]

_solely_ to the raising of revenue for the current needs of the
Government and the expenditure thereof, shall go to the Senate for

The primary assembly structures provided within the HNeT system are illustrated
below for the cerebellar and neo-cortical models. The HNeT library provides an
array of functions for customization of individual cell architectures, cell assembly
architectures, synaptic interconnectivity, neural plasticity (synaptic pruning and
regrowth), customization of supervised, unsupervised, spatial-temporal and
hyper-incursive neural models, data conversion and preprocessing. A function
reference sheet for the HNeT API language is available upon request.

Neo-Cortical Model
HNeT technology provides an exceptionally high "connection per second" or CPS
rating; in excess of with and and  Million CPS on Pentium IV processors. This allows the
system to learn and/or respond to several millions of input patterns per second.
Advanced features of neural plasticity are provided. Neural plasticity allows the
HNeT system to optimize and reconfigure cell assembly structures and synaptic
interconnections in an automated manner.
An extensive library of conversion formats are provided for orthogonalization of
input data streams, including histogram normalization, Fourier, Gabor and wavelet
transforms. Custom algorithms may be integrated as post-processing transforms
within HNeT cells.
Permits dynamic (on line) modification of virtually all cell properties such as
synaptic and axonal interconnection, neural plasticity, cortical memory, learning
rate, execution sequence, etc.

the horrific acts of Defendant Trump via mass media coverage of him starting last summer that, over a
short period of time, became continuous and unavoidable.
11.
The duress had prevented me from starting litigation before this year. However, as soon as I
surfaced, I received threats. More specifically, shortly after my first complaint was filed in California on
April 26, 2016, I started receiving threatening phone calls on a cell phone I then owned. The calls were
never for more than 20 seconds or so before they hung up and they were always from a blocked or
unavailable phone number according to my caller ID feature. Since I changed phone numbers, the
threatening calls have completely stopped.
12.
This litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and I believe
that identification of me would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to me and to others.
13.
I have no reason to believe that the Defendants' threats have ever been lifted or will ever be
lifted and so I request that the Court issue an order protecting me and my family from harm and
harassment by the Defendants.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
