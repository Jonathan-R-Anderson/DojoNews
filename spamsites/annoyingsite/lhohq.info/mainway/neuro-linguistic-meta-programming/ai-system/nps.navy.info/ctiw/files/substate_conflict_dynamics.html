 Council condemns the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and expresses its serious concern at those economic activities that fuel the conflict. It urges the Governments named in the report in this regard to conduct their own inquiries into this information, cooperate fully with the Expert Panel while ensuring necessary security for the experts, and take immediate steps to end illegal exploitation of the natural resources by their nationals or others under their control.

“The Security Council notes with concern the terrible toll the conflict is taking on the people, economy and environment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

“The Security Council believes that the only viable solution to the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains the full implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement (S/1999/815) and the relevant Security Council resolutions.

“The Security Council emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach addressing all the root causes of the conflict to achieve a lasting peace settlement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

“The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to extend the mandate of the Expert Panel for a final period of three months, and requests also that the Expert Panel submit to the Council, through the Secretary-General, an addendum to its final report which shall include the following:

(U) Cover Stories (U)
(C) When traveling to the partner’s facility or other program sites, family members and
co-workers (who are not cleared), can be given generic travel plans, i.e., ”Going to Baltimore,
MD to do H/W and/or S/W Engineering”, and/or “will be in Baltimore, MD for the day at
another company”. Provide family members/co-workers with cell phone/hotel phone numbers to
reach you at and to leave messages for you. Also give your family a co-worker’s (not on TDY
with you) phone number so that if there is an emergency at home, your family can contact your
co-worker who can then contact you at the facility.

Cell Morphology
The primary assembly structures provided within the HNeT system are illustrated
below for the cerebellar and neo-cortical models. The HNeT library provides an
array of functions for customization of individual cell architectures, cell assembly
architectures, synaptic interconnectivity, neural plasticity (synaptic pruning and
regrowth), customization of supervised, unsupervised, spatial-temporal and
hyper-incursive neural models, data conversion and preprocessing. A function
reference sheet for the HNeT API language is available upon request.

Neo-Cortical Model
HNeT technology provides an exceptionally high "connection per second" or CPS
rating; in excess of 200 Million CPS on Pentium IV processors. This allows the
system to learn and/or respond to several millions of input patterns per second.
Advanced features of neural plasticity are provided. Neural plasticity allows the
HNeT system to optimize and reconfigure cell assembly structures and synaptic
interconnections in an automated manner.
An extensive library of conversion formats are provided for orthogonalization of
input data streams, including histogram normalization, Fourier, Gabor and wavelet
transforms. Custom algorithms may be integrated as post-processing transforms
within HNeT cells.
Permits dynamic (on line) modification of virtually all cell properties such as
synaptic and axonal interconnection, neural plasticity, cortical memory, learning
rate, execution sequence, etc.
