“There is little hope that anything may be saved when among the leaders of a new movement there are no men capable of integrating the material struggle with a secret and inexorable knowledge, one that is not at the service of dark forces but stands instead on the side of the luminous principle of traditional spirituality.”

In short, we must fully understand the methods of our Adversaries in order to effectively combat and counter them in the Occult War.

TACTICS OF THE OCCULT WAR: “REPLACING INFILTRATIONS”.

“Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.” George Orwell.

"The chief problem in historical honesty is not outright lying. It is omission or de-emphasis of important data. The definition of 'important,' of course, depends on one's values." Howard Zinn, Failure to Quit.

What we know about our history as a people and a culture essentially shapes a large part of our world experience. When it is changed or downgraded and rewritten in politically correct ways, we not only lose part of our heritage and traditions, we lose an essential part of ourselves. As important as this is to those of us who discuss such things, we have to realize how incredibly ignorant the general public is in today’s dumbed-down world. Not only are they ignorant of anything remotely resembling concepts like the Occult War and the occult dimension of history, they hardly know anything at all about American history, not to mention their abysmal ignorance of world history. This condition makes “average Joe and Jane” susceptible to a number of mind control methods. The Adversaries use this fully and forcefully to their advantage.

Politically correct mainline media news and the accompanying stories now called history are largely composed of lies and misrepresentations, yet presented to us as truth incarnate. But fewer and fewer people are buying the story. What comes to us in the network media is mostly mind control and manipulation. And, if you wander around bookstores, libraries and the Internet, you know that the accepted and promulgated history textbooks (and lectures) never mention anything remotely resembling that of which we speak. From time to time, there is a hint of occult and secret societies in some cable broadcasts, but most of this is nothing more than distractions and distortions. As we’ve observed, this ancient war goes back to the beginnings of time.
