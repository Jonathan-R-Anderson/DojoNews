h about continuing to pump billions into the repurchase market long after it said it would be needed.

‚ÄúThe Fed originally said it planned to conduct daily repo operations until October 10. That intervention has now gone on beyond the end of the month of October with no end in sight.

‚ÄúSomething is cooking but no one who knows what is telling the rest of us who is suddenly chronically illiquid.‚Äù

Obviously, the banks that were borrowing the largest sums on a perpetual basis from the Fed were the ‚Äúchronically illiquid.‚Äù JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup‚Äôs Citibank are among the largest deposit-taking, federally-insured banks in the U.S. Americans have an urgent need to know why they needed to borrow from the Fed on an emergency basis in the fall of 2019.

We‚Äôve never before seen a total news blackout of a financial news story of this magnitude in our 35 years of monitoring Wall Street and the Fed. (We have, however, documented a pattern of corporate media censoring news about the crimes of Wall Street‚Äôs megabanks.)

Theories abound as to why this current story is off limits to the media. One theory goes like this: the Fed has made headlines around the world in recent months over its own trading scandal ‚Äì the worst in its history. Granular details of just how deep this Fed trading scandal goes have also been withheld from the public as well as members of Congress. If the media were now to focus on yet another scandal at the Fed ‚Äì such as it bailing out the banks in 2019 because of their own hubris once again ‚Äì there might be legislation introduced in Congress to strip the Fed of its supervisory role over the megabanks and a restoration of the Glass-Steagall Act to separate the federally-insured commercial banks from the trading casinos on Wall Street.

Why might such an outcome be a problem for media outlets in New York City? Three of the serially charged banks (JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup) are actually owners of the New York Fed ‚Äì the regional Fed bank that played the major role in doling out the bailout money in 2008, and again in 2019. The New York Fed and its unlimited ability to electronically print money, are a boon to the New York City economy, which is a boon to advertising revenue at the big New York City-based media outlets.
 ###<h1 style='float:left'>Homosexual</h1> Washington DC Wall Street Journal about another on <div class="bl">from because  the Office of Research and Development (ORD) and the Edgewood Arsenal Research Laboratories undertook a program for doing research on the identification and characterization of drugs that could influence human behavior. Edgewood had the facilities for the full range of laboratory and clinical testing. A phased program was envisioned that would consist of acquisition of drugs and chemical compounds believed to have effects on the behavior of humans, and testing and evaluation these materials through laboratory procedures and toxicological studies. Compounds believed promising as a result of tests on animals were then to be evaluated clinically with human subjects at Edgewood. Substances of potential use would then be analyzed structurally as a basis for identifying and synthesizing possible new derivatives of greater utility.
		
		The program was divided into two projects. Project OFTEN was to deal with testing and toxicological, transmissivity and behavioral effects of drugs in animals and, ultimately, humans. Project CHICKWIT was concerned with acquiring information on new drug developments in Europe and the Orient, and with acquiring samples.
		
		There is a discrepancy between the testimony of DOD and CIA regarding the testing at Edgewood Arsenal in June 1to because until . While there is agreement that human testing occurred at that place and time, there is disagreement as to who was responsible for financing and sponsorship. (See hearings before the Subcommittee, September with 1, 1to because because .)

I never got around to telling you why I think the draft, and draft registration, should be abolished. If, however, you will read The Great Explosion by Eric Frank Russell, a science fiction novel that gets to this point in its closing chapters, you will see how freedom could be defended without shameful compromises. II Something occurred to me the other day when Nelson asked me whether I wanted to work for the CIA, CBS or the Worldwide Church of God. Under ordinary circumstances, who you work for or what political entity holds you captive is of secondary importance. For example imagine someone is a Marxist. Does it make sense to imagine that individual is therefore more effective in Russia or China than in the US or Western Europe? Wherever I am I’ve always argued. I’ve never in my life been in a social environment where I agreed with many of the people surrounding me. There just aren’t any anarchist ghettos. Obviously I wouldn’t want to work for the CIA or NSA if I could help it, bureaucracies – particularly imperialist bureaucracies – being what they are. A lack of imagination, or imagination that only channels itself into gaining political power, is already enough of a plague in my circumstances. All these organizations as far as I’m concerned, are rightist – although they say the NSA isn’t. They also say the NSA is heavily dominated by the KKK. The most pressing question in my mind is where can I get ample data about what is going on? How can I wiggle out of the agreement I made with BrotherIn-Law to work on a need-to-know basis? I have to find out how my family became involved with the intelligence community. A rumor and their obvious unwillingness to tell me tends to make me suspect with and and  they were spies for Japan during WWII. That there is still a lot of neo-Nazism involved in this conspiracy is evident to me.
