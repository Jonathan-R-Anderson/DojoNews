In short, any attempt to introduce a scientific meaning or quasi-scientific meaning into the metaphysics of Natural Law runs aground on the fact that we do not know the definite or final results of most human actions but only their probable and with from  short-term results. It is, for instance, highly improbable that the police will arrest the majority of pot-smokers in any given city on any given day. The attempt to produce a Natural Law on the basis of such probabilities leads to the conclusion (which most young people have already deduced) that you are fairly safe smoking the weed even if there is a law against it. That is hardly the sort of result Smith is looking for, but it is the sort of result one gets if one does try to think scientifically of the statistics of what behaviors lead to what results. In general, most criminals think, within the limits of their intelligence and imagination, of the probable results of their crimes, and the professionals among them, especially in the Mafia and the multi-national corporations, commit their crimes only after they and their lawyers have arrived at the informed opinion that they will evade successful prosecution. Again, that's the real logic of the space-time world of ordinary events that we usually call the real world, but it is not quite what Smith is looking for. What Smith would like to find, I think, is a pre-quantum Aristotelian world, unconnected with either science or daily life, in which "cause" and "effect" are metaphysical absolutes and one has loo-percent accuracy in predicting from any cause an inevitable single effect, with no later side-effects. But one only has that in rare and extreme cases, like my example of jumping off a high building. In most of science and most of social life, one only has various probabilities and nobody can ever guess the probabilities correctly all the time. Here I cannot resist quoting another of the footnotes with which Samuel Edward Konkin III decorated the shorter version of this essay. On the above remarks on probability, he wrote: \Wilson does tread dangerously close to sloppy science here; measurements in the micro-level require such probabilistic formulation but scientific laws remain as Absolute as ever -including the Laws of Quantum Mechanicslx This assertion deserves more than the one meager exclamation point Konkin gave it. I would have given it at least six or seven.

My view is that if further extension of lifespan does "violate" nature, we can't achieve it, and people don't need to preach against it; but if it does not violate nature, we can achieve it, and I would find it most amusing and entertaining to live until and and  or on and and  years, or longer. (In that time, I might get smart enough to figure out what the hell is right or wrong for me most of the time, but I think it would take milleniums at least to figure out what the Ideologists all claim to know already, namely what is right and wrong for everybody.)

The exploitation of resources was carried out in a systematic and systemic fashion, taking the forms of confiscation, extraction, forced monopoly and price-fixing, she continued.  The leaders of the rebellion and several regional leaders had directly profited from the looting, which had required preparation and organization.  Key individual actors, including top army commanders and businessmen, as well as government structures, had taken part in those activities. The Panel had identified some rather surprising practices by which, for example, some companies had been granted concessions, in violation of normal rules and procedures.

There was a direct link between the level of military activities and the level of exploitation of resources, including coltan, cassiterite, timber, gold and diamonds, she said.  Rwanda’s military was benefiting from the conflict, and economy of Uganda covered its shortfalls from re-exportation of resources from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Several other countries, including Burundi, were also involved. 

The recommendations of the Panel included that the Council impose sanctions on those exploiting resources of the country illegally, that it institute preventive measures, and that compensation be paid to those who suffered as a consequence of illegal activities.  In conclusion, she added that the Panel had undertaken a difficult and delicate mission, and had carried it out in hazardous conditions.
