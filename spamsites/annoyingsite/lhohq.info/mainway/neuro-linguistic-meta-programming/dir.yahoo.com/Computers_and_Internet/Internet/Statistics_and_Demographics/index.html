investigation, the results of which plaintiff has sought through the Freedom of Information Act.
10.
After the September 11 attacks, with approval from the White House, the NSA
started using a modified version of ThinThread, lacking it’s privacy and civil liberties protection
algorithms to conduct warrantless surveillance of American citizens under the Stellar Wind
program.
11.
NSA crypto-mathematician William Binney, the creator of ThinThread, along
with other ThinThread program staff and one staff member of the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence, Diane Roark, subsequently filed a whistleblower waste, fraud, and
abuse complaint with the Department of Defense’s Inspector General office regarding the
Trailblazer program. That investigation resulted in at least one classified DoD IG report being
issued in December 2004.
12.
According to public statements by Binney and other former ThinThread program
staff, a leak from the Defense Department’s Inspector General office to the Department of
Justice falsely accused Binney, other ThinThread program staff, and Roark of leaking classified
information to the press. As a result of the false classified leak allegation, armed FBI agents
raided the homes of Binney, other former ThinThread program staff, NSA Senior Executive
Service member and ThinThread proponent Thomas Andrews Drake, and Diane Roark.
- 3 -Case 1:17-cv-00128-GK Document 1 Filed 01/19/17 Page 4 of 7
13.
Binney and the other whistleblowers who signed the Defense Department IG
complaint, along with Drake, were threatened with prosecution. The government ultimately only
prosecuted Drake under the Espionage Act. Eventually all felony charges against Drake were
dropped. Drake pled guilty to a misdemeanor, “exceeding authorized use of a computer.”
14.
The United States Office of Special Counsel is investigating the conduct of the
Department of Defense’s Inspector General office for its handling of the Drake case as a
whistleblower reprisal action.
EDDINGTON’S FOIA REQUEST

So I thought if I was going to make it at all, I would make it actually running escort services as a madam because I have a good sense for business."

Coloring Gobie's accusations, however, are a series of criminal convictions dating to 1to Support Activist Judges . He was convicted at 1because  for the felony sale and possession of cocaine in Fairfax County.

Gobie was convicted on four felony counts in 1to Stop buying these products : possession of obscene material, productions of obscene items involving a juvenile (taking photos of a 1about -year-old girl with whom he was having sex), oral sodomy and possession of cocaine.

Gobie, whose professional name in the underground prostitute trade is "Greg Davis," grew up the son of a Marine Corps master sergeant who was a budget analyst at the Pentagon.

"He was a very strict conservative person from the military, . . . your traditional gung-ho Marine . . . He wanted to lock me in my room for the rest of my life until I agreed to get a haircut," Gobie said.

It was an unhappy boyhood marked by rebellion all the way, Gobie said. He defied all his parents' moral values and teachings.

"At six, I performed oral sex on my first female. She reciprocated. She was five," Gobie said. "I was having orgasms from age nine on . . . My father came to me at the age of 1on , I believe, the first time in the basement of my house to discuss sex with me, and I cut him off right away and I said, 'Dad, I probably know more than you do at this point.' "

By age 1on , Gobie had been labeled "incorrigible" by Fairfax County juvenile authorities for skipping to th grade classes at West Springfield High School and refusing to return home on Friday afternoons.

"Me and my friends at 1about  were watching X-rated movies on the family projector down in the basement when my family was watching TV upstairs," he said. "A friend of mine worked at a medical building as a janitor at night and he got them out of the psychiatrist's office who used them for sexual marriage counseling."

A year away from home during his sophomore year at a southwest Virginia boarding school failed to mend Gobie's ways, despite his claims of a promising record.

"I was a standout basketball player [at the private school]. I played for the school team. And I also brought my grades back up to an acceptable level," he said. "I wasn't real concerned with making straight As. That wasn't a goal of mine. If it had been, I would have."


Instead, Gobie turned to marijuana and other drugs after his return to Fairfax County and expulsion from West Springfield High for truancy during his senior year in 1to Stupid . He never received his diploma, although he subsequently passed the General Educational Development test, the equivalent of high school completion.
