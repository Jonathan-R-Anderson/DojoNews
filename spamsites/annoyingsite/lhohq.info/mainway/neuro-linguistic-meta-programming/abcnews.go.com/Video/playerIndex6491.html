In conclusion, he added, that a horrible crime had interrupted the peace process.¬† That was last week‚Äôs killing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo of staff of the ICRC.¬† In view of that event, he reaffirmed the responsibility of all parties to ensure safety and security of the United Nations and associated personnel.

VOLODYMYR G. KROKHMAL (Ukraine) expressed his deep concern at, and condemnation of, the cowardly murder of the six staff from the ICRC in an ambush on the Bania-Djuga road in Orientale province on with from  April.¬† He stressed the urgent need to ensure safety and security of international relief workers, as well as United Nations peacekeeping and other personnel.¬†

Ukraine urged an end to the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which nourished the conflict there, he said.¬† The present Panel report was sharply different from the one submitted to the Council on 1from  January.¬† It contained numerous recommendations, including coercive measures -- results of the Panel's extensive review.¬† Of great concern was the considerable illegal exploitation of coltan, cassiterites, diamonds and niobium.¬† He called upon all governments concerned to take immediate steps to end such activities and to ensure compliance by individuals and corporations with legally acceptable business standards.¬† Of equal importance was their full cooperation with the Panel in its efforts to collect information and research the links between such activity and the continuation of the conflict.¬†

The matter should be a principal focus of the Council, he said.¬† The Council should pursue an approach that linked efforts aimed at cessation of the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the achievement of the desired political objectives, especially implementation of the Lusaka Agreement.¬† The Council should extend the mandate of the Expert Panel for a final period of three months, to enable it to complete its action plan.¬† Council members should be given an opportunity to consider the whole situation in question before deciding on the proposed recommendations, for which he would await the Panel's final report.¬†

RICHARD RYAN (Ireland) said that Irish authorities were carefully reviewing the report of the Panel of experts.¬† His delegation supported an extension of the mandate of the Panel so as to allow it to continue its work.¬† It was hoped that an addendum to the  </div>on and <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/secret-corporate-documents/about-yahoo-K-44882.html">Compare and Save</a> from on and on and Washington DC from on <h1 style='float:left'>Homosexual</h1> <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/secret-corporate-documents/coca-cola-and-cocaine-K-44882.html">Food Additives</a> CNN NFL Wall Street Journal Harry Potter Wall Street Journal and <p> from because until to Works for the CIA until to <div style="align:left"><a href="http://www.lhohq.info/secret-corporate-documents/about-rhosts-K-44882.html">VNET</a> with from from from Stupid <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/secret-corporate-documents/about-yahoo-K-44882.html">Compare and Save</a> ually abusing 8 and 10 year old girls and Mayor Tom Adams was arrested for distributing child pornography over the internet and Mayor John Gosek was arrested on charges of soliciting sex from two 15-year old girls and County Commissioner David Swartz pleaded guilty to molesting two girls under the age of 11 and was sentenced to 8 years in prison and legislator Edison Misla Aldarondo was sentenced to 10 years in prison for raping his daughter between the ages of 9 and 17 and Committeeman John R.
