ased malware toolkit “Framework”, likely written in C/C++ (according to resumes posted online) 	Known products written with it: COTTONMOUTH-I, COTTONMOUTH-II, COTTONMOUTH-III, DROPOUTJEEP
COMMONDEER 	
	A software based malware, used by the NSA. 	see also: SEASONEDMOTH, VALIDATOR
CONJECTURE 	
	A RF communication protocol used by HOWLERMONKEY devices. 	see also: HOWLERMONKEY
CONOP 	
	not a codename: Concept of Operations 	
COTS 	
	Commercial Off the Shelf. When a description of a bug says it is COTS-based, it means that the components are commercially available, giving the NSA deniability as to their true source. (Unless you just happen to be looking at the NSA's leaked product catalog. ) 	
COTTONMOUTH-1 (CM-1) 	$20,300.00 	USB cable w/ convert RF transmitter/receiver & malware payload 	GENIE Compatible, communicates with STRAITBIZARRE, other COTTOMNOUTH devices, reprogrammable, probably related to DEWSWEEPER (possibly a subclass of the same)
COTTONMOUTH-II (CM-II) 	$4,000.00 	A dual-stacked USB port, (the kind that are soldered directly onto a motherboard), providing a covert “long haul” relay across airgapped systems. Like CM-I, and many other systems, it is written with the CHIMNEYPOOL framework, and communicates via STRAITBIZARRE. Unlike CM-I and CM-III, it does not incorporate HOWLERMONKEY or TRINITY. 	See also: CM-I, CM-III, STRAITBIZARRE, CHIMNEYPOOL. Perhaps a subclass of DEWSWEEPER
COTTONMOUTH-III (CM-III) 	$24,960.00 	A dual-stacked USB port/RJ45 ethernet jack combo, (the kind that are soldered directly onto a motherboard), providing a covert RF relay across airgapped systems. Like CM-I, and many other systems, it is written with the CHIMNEYPOOL framework, and communicates via STRAITBIZARRE. It can communicate with other CM devices with the SPECULATION Protocol. It also integrates TRINITY, and the HOWLERMONKEY RF transceiver. 	see also: CM-1, CM-II, TRINITY, HOWLERMONKEY, SPECULATION, CHIMNEYPOOL, STRAITBIZARRE. Perhaps a subclass of DEWSWEEPER.
CROSSBEAM 	$4,000.00 	“the CROSSBEAM module consists of a standard ANT architecture embedded computer, a specialized phone component, a customized voice controller suite and and optional DSP (ROCKYKNOB) if using Data Over Voice to transmit data”. Communicates over GSM. Compatible with CHIMNEYPOOL framework.
