John B. Alexander, Acoustics, in Future War, Non-Lethal Weapons in
Twenty-First Century Warfare, NY, Thomas Dunne Books, 1999. pp. 95-102
Details the use of high-power ultrasound weapons on humans and the built environment. These
weapons, developed in this country by Scientific Applications and Research Associates (SARA) in
California, among others, have the capacity to cause pain, to cause inattention, sleepiness,
and fatigue, to disrupt mental reasoning. PPS (Pulsed Periodic Stimuli) weapons also
developed at SARA according to Alexander, are capable of causing neurophysiological distress
and perceptual disorientation. Ultrasound can also weaken structures and potentially cause
objects to move.

This list is of interest because of the range of technologies which it includes
and because it lists technologies, such neuro-implants -- described as Computer implants
into the brain which allow for behavioral modification and control -- as nonlethal weapons,
whereas the research objectives for implants are often differently stated.

Among the other nonlethal weapons it lists are: Pheromones, Electromagnetic Interference,
Hologram, Death, described as a Hologram used to scare a target individual to death,
and Optical, Low Energy Laser-Eye Safe, descibed as a continuous wave laser mounted on
a rifle, that produces a high-intensity glare strong enough to temporarily delay and
disorient an adversary....

Note: Although some Non-Lethal Weapons may
(depending on what they actually do) be more humane in battle
situations, many have the potential of being covertly used against civilians,
for instance, to interfere with the performance of athletes, to interfere with the work
of artists and writers, to interfere with the work of women in the sciences.

They could also be used to make peaceful demonstration very difficult.

Jonathan D. Moreno, Mind Wars, Brain Research and National Defense,
NY, NY; Washington, DC: Dana Press, 2006.
With an emphasis on DARPA funding, Jonathan Moreno's Mind Wars,
Brain Research and National Defense provides an overview of brain invasive
technologies that include the neuro-control of animals, brain fingerprinting,
building better soldiers (his terminology) and nonlethal weapons.

In a section entitled No Pain No Gain, (pp. 153-154) Moreno discusses the ADS
(active-denial system) that uses microwave beams to induce pain, as well as nociceptor
stimulation using pulsed energy projectiles.(PEPS) (Note that he does not
adequately address the potential for technologies that allow access to the brain
to be used to control human minds in order to cause pain nor does the book, in the whole,
provide adequate space to synthetic telemetry research.)

In the context of pain-inducing NLW testing , the author suggests that calling human
experiments field trials, in order to circumvent human experiment ethics is acceptable.

And in a chilling segment, he observes that seemingly the military considers that if doctors
are not in charge, such tests could be considered a field trial rather than a human
experiment.

Speaking of cold war tests in which soldiers and sailors were
purposefully exposed to Atomic bomb and chemical nerve agents, he writes:
One can argue whether there was deliberate duplicity on the part of
military officials in these cases or not, but I don't think so. In fact,
it's often not easy to tell the difference between developing a new
device or training for a new situation and conducting a human experiment. (p. 157)

Moreno's claim to be in the middle of the ethical debate on the use of mind
invasive technologies is also belied by, among other things, his unethical advocacy
for Augcog enhancements on soldiers: Soldiers aren't normally asked for their
informed consent before accepting what their command regards as the best preparation
for battle. If the question is purely a moral one, than it's difficult to see why
these AugCog enhancements should be regarded differently from anything else a soldier
can be legally ordered to do. (p. 53)

On the whole, the book seems to be a DARPA whitewash. Nevertheless, Mind Wars does
at least raise ethics issues, and because there are few book length overviews of military
neuroscience, the book is a contribution to the literature -- providing cogent evidence that there
is a concerted DOD research agenda in neuro-technologies.

This experiment in mind-body control -- involving implanting
electrodes in monkey's brains -- was performed by scientists
at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, MIT,
and the State University of New York (SUNY) Health Science Center.
Questions that should be asked are: What control would this give
researchers over the minds of people with disabilities?
What are the protections for patients from the potential that
researchers who interfere with animal minds will also think their
research priorities allow them to interfere with human minds and/or
make decisions for patients without consulting them?
Could this technology be used in virtual commander situations
where the men and women in our armed forces could be controlled
in battlefield situations.

Note also that the 600 mile range of brain control demonstrated
could allow to unethical researchers to utilize these technologies
across state borders.

This research was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health,
the National Science Foundation, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, and the Office of Naval Research.

By combining Jorgensen's device and a cochlear implant with a radio transmitter and a

bypasses the acoustic realm altogether.


The author's enthusiam for synthetic telemetry does not encompass the terrible incursions
on the human mind and the potential for inquisition-type interogation that could result
without detection and legislation. Nevertheless, he does present an informed report of some
of the many ways this could be done and some of the researchers who are working in this field.

According to this report, Eliot Chapple [Harvard Medical School, President of
the Society for Applied Anthroplogy] and his colleague, Dr. C. F. Harding made
brain wave records of two people talking and were able to appraise human relations
scientifically, Chapple advocated the use of this technology to size up applicants

...The C.I.A. men who led the way, enlisting the support of the Army,
the Navy, the Air Force, the Departments of Agriculture, Health, Education and
Welfare and several other agencies, acknowledged among themselves that much of
what they were setting out to do was 'unethical', bordered on the illegal
and would be repugnant to the American people. So they made certain that
these activities were tightly held, known only to the director,
Allen W. Dulles, and a handful of operatives and high-ranking aides....

Brain implants have been used to 'read the minds' of monkeys
to predict what they are about to do and even how enthusiastic
they are about doing it.

In what is bound to become a much debated and highly controversial experiment,
a team of US scientists have wired a computer
to a cat's brain and created videos of what the animal was seeing...



Background - Neuroscience Institutes
Much of the research at these facilities is beneficial.
However, so that the public can understand how applied brain invasive
technologies could negatively affect the future of our world, it is
important to look at the whole picture of research.

It is also important to build a case for the need for legislation
to be put in place to protect against brain invasive technologies
being used without consent or knowledge. Because brain invasive technologies
are not always detectable or provable, the potential exists for criminal
researchers and rogue law enforcement to create a theater of our lives for
their own amusement or to silently persecute citizens with whom they
personally disagree.

Access to the brain is essentially access to the body and its functions.
For instance, someone could be driven to suicide or detrimental actions.
Wireless communications technologies in tandem with neural implants could
facilitate access to our minds.


Although there may be instances where neural implants could help people
with disabilities, to this author, an artist/writer with a disability, it appears
that people with disabilities are, in some cases, being used as an excuse
to develop very invasive research and that neither the public nor
the disability community are being adequately informed of the dangers of the
technologies being developed, of alternative approaches, or of the potential
criminal uses of these technologies.

It is important to remember that if neuro-technologies are being
abused it is not necessarily the inventors of the technologies who are actually
doing this. However, many of the researchers in this field have not adequately
communicated the import of their work. If researchers in this field believe that
socially acceptable benefits of neural technologies may be realized, it is vitally
important that they inform the public of the potential for misuse of these technologies,
as well as set in motion legislation to protect the public and to ensure that no
intelligence agencies, law enforcement or corporations have covert and/or moral
and socially unacceptable access to brain invasive technologies.

The fact that unscrupulous researchers in these fields have not adequately informed
the public of the dangers is a strong indication not only that the source of their
funding is all too often the very agencies that could abuse brain invasive technologies
but also that there are questions about whether or not the potential for abuse
outweighs the potential benefits.

Yet there is hope that if the public is adequately informed and protections
are in place, in the frontiers of neuroscience research there may indeed be
benefits for the disability community and for many others.

Control of populations is the subtext Kitson's Low Intensity Operations.

The book is chilling in its lack of understanding of the moral and positive
roles of protest, strikes, and the voices of a country's citizen's in
a free country. However, it is instructive in understanding this British Army officer's mindset that
had a pervasive influence on British attempts at covert control of whole populations
-- as evidenced in the British treatment of Ireland -- as well as on covert actions by US
intelligence agencies in South America and against American citizens. (...it is in men's minds
that wars of subversion have to be fought and decided. Kitson p. 31)

the Air Force treats global weather as a battleground. In their words:
...weather-modification is a force multiplier with tremendous power
that could be exploited across the full spectrum of war-fighting environments.
From enhancing friendly operations or disrupting those of the enemy via
small-scale tailoring of natural weather patterns to complete dominance of
global communications and counter-space control, weather-modification offers
the war fighter a wide-range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary...

Spy Satellites

John C. Baker, Kevin M. O'Connell, and Ray A. Williamson, eds.
Commercial Observation Satellites At the Leading Edge of Global
Transparency, RAND Monographs/Reports MR1229, 2001
http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1229/
This document gives an overview of global access to observation satellites
and addresses the issues of global transparency that this has created, including
potentially beneficial information, such as civilian access to information about nuclear
buildup. The framing of open skies issues in the context of the rights of photographers
and first amendment rights is important because advocates of privacy rights
should be aware that these issues are also important.

However, this report gives scant coverage to privacy rights, nor does it adequately address
how private citizens could be protected from stalking and harassment by users of satellite
data who spy on their lives and movements.

The assumption of many of the contributors to this report -- that the use
of observation satellites is, for better or worse, here to stay -- should be
re-examined in terms of the importance to human beings of privacy and of
the kind of world we want to live in the future.

New Surveillance Technologies
The research listed here may be in many respects beneficial,
and the listing of projects here is not meant to imply that the
researchers themselves are advocating a surveillance society.
Indeed, it is precisely because researchers are often not in a position
to control function creep from their work that we the public should look at
the long term consequences of research that could contribute to surveillance
society.

For instance, technology to scan grocery receipts and analyze purchases
for nutritional content could be beneficial if used personally. But
function creep from this research could create a situation --
with overtones of a slave society -- where Insurance companies,
the Armed Forces, and unethical doctors who spy on their patients
for insurance companies, drug companies, and/or DARPA could easily spy

Surveillance and Harassment: NSA/Echelon

James Bamford, Body of Secrets, NY, Doubleday, 2001
http://www.randomhouse.com/features/bamford/author.html
pp 420-451 deal with the Echelon system and NSA abuses in
spying on American citizens and citizens of other nations and in exchange
of information with other UKUSA members.

Of particular interest is Shamrock (p. 434) in which US telegraph companies
such as Western Union, secretly gave the NSA access to *all* overseas
communications from American citizens.

Disclosure of the continued FBI spying on German writers and artists
who came to this country to escape Nazi persecution.

In describing Alexander's book, Yale University Press notes that
Not only the FBI but also the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
the House Un-American Activities Committee, and other
agencies spied on the German emigres. Wiretaps were installed,
mail was routinely opened and read, records of visitors were maintained.
Searches--not always with legal warrants--were conducted, informants
hired, and connections to exile writers established...

A comparison of the Government whitewash of Nazi war criminal
Arthur Rudolph with the FBI's continued harassing observation of writer
Thomas Mann and union activist Cesar Chavez is particularly instructive.
Rudolph was made Saturn Moon Rocket Project Director by NASA, and the FBI files
repeatedly note: ...consider Rudolph reliable, trustworthy, adaptable, conscientious
and potentially good loyal American... But eventually Rudolph left
this country rather than face charges for the murder of thousands of concentration
camp workers.

Includes Church Committee reports on Intelligence Activities and the Rights
of Americans.

The following is part of Church Committee findings on Using Covert Action
to Disrupt and Discredit Domestic Groups:

The Committee finds that covert action programs have been used to disrupt
the lawful political activities of individual Americans and groups and to
discredit them, using dangerous and degrading tactics which are abhorrent
in a free and decent society.

Subfindings

(a) Although the claimed purposes of these action programs were to protect
the national security and to prevent violence, many of the victims were concededly
nonviolent, were not controlled by a foreign power, and posed no threat to the national
security.

(b)The acts taken interfered with the First Amendment rights of citizens.
They were explicitly intended to deter citizens from joining groups,
neutralize those who were already members, and prevent or inhibit the
expression of ideas.

(c) The tactics used against Americans often risked and sometimes caused serious emotional,
economic, or physical damage. Actions were taken which were designed to break up marriages,
terminate funding or employment, and encourage gang warfare between violent rival groups.
Due process of law forbids the use of such covert tactics, whether the victims are
innocent law-abiding citizens or members of groups suspected of involvement in violence.

(d) The sustained use of such tactics by the FBI in an attempt to
destroy Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., violated the law and fundamental human decency.

colleagues, family, friends and neighbors. This activity apparently has
increased as the Republican Convention and the November election draw near.
If that's not a chilling effect, I don't know what is. The price

Infiltration - The OSS


Anthony Cave Brown, The Last Hero: Wild Bill Donovan,
NY: Times Books, 1982.

Carey, Frank, It's Anthropologists' Plan To Prevent Future Wars, The Washington Post, April 19, 1942.

Carleton S. Coon, Harvard, Conrad M. Arensberg, Brooklyn College, and Eliot D. Chapple, Harvard
Medical School and President of the Society for Applied Anthropology propose
a United States of the World with a world police force that would control
the whole federation. The proposal would seem merely ludicrous
but for the fact that subsequently Carleton Coon was chosen by Wild Bill
Donovan as an agent of the fledging OSS.(that later became the CIA)
Anthony Cave Brown (Anthony Cave Brown, The Last Hero: Wild Bill Donovan,
NY: Times Books, 1982, pp. 269-270) quotes a memo from Coon to Donovan in which
Coon not only advocates political assassination but also suggests that a group
of men be chosen for this purpose from the OSS and the British SOE.


One of the other men who proposed this global police state (couched in idealistic language) was
Eliot Chapple, an early brain wave researcher. See Waldemar Kaempffert, Science in the News: Brain
Waves, The New York Times, July 7, 1940 for a report of Eliot Chapple's use of brain
wave recordings in the study of relationships.

Wicker, Tom, The Truth is Needed, The New York Times,
December 24, 1974.
...Congress, the White House, the American people have been assured
repeatedly that the C.I.A., barred by law from any operations within the United States, does
not conduct such operations. Now The New York Times has published strong allegations
that the agency did just that -- and these allegations are supported by Mr. Ford's
[President Ford] refusal to say that internal surveillances had not been carried on in the
past, and by his concession that he had some of the information in The Times' article
before it appeared...

Impressment. Wikipedia -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressment
The British Navy's impressment of over 6,000 American sailors
was one of the causes of the War of 1812.

Charles Berlitz with the collaboration of J. Manson Valentine,
The Bermuda Triangle Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1974.
Although Berlitz does not cite this as a possible cause,
the finding of so many ships without their crews in the vicinity of Bermuda
from where the British sailed to burn Washington and the White House in 1814
and where they held a military presence until 1957 and an espionage station
during WWII, suggests the possibility of impressment by the British. Bermuda was
where the British imprisoned Irish slaves and the Scots who fought Cromwell in the
17th century. See Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince, Frommer's Bermuda 2006
Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2006. pp 225-229 for a History of the British presence in Bermuda.

Stephenson had agents in Baltimore, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Houston.

http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIId.htm (Paul Wolf's COINTELPRO web site)
Although it provides only limited information, this report does conclude that
The intelligence informant technique is not a precise instrument.
By its very nature,it risks governmental monitoring of
Constitutionally-protected activity and the private lives of Americans.
Unlike electronic surveillance and wiretaps, there are few standards
and no outside review system for the use of intelligence informants.
Consequently, the risk of chilling the exercise of First Amendment
rights and infringing citizen privacy is increased. In addition, existing
guidelines for informant conduct, particularly with respect to their
role in violent organizations and FBI use of intelligence informants
to obtain the private documents of groups and individuals, need to be
clarified and strengthened.

stalking techniques. The book is better in its identification of gang stalking
techniques that it is in its analysis of who the perpetrators actually are.

Although I do not agree with much of her other writing, this article is
one of the clearest that I have seen on the issue of Gang-stalking,
and it points out that some members of the right as well the left are being subjected
to mobbing harassment -- the practice of groups of people following
activists and interfering with their lives.



Gang Stalking - Possible War Game Connections
Although there is no evidence that the specific projects listed below have disrupted
the lives of innocent civilians (or that the researchers involved in these projects
have designed field experiments targeting civilians) certain military research and
Operations Plans suggest research and attack strategies that could potentially result
in illegal field experiments that target civilians in the areas of traffic and driving
disruption in war game simulations; theft of supplies; destruction of equipment;
the use of robots/robotic devices to create disturbances; the mapping of human response
to invasive cognitive research; and contingently the effect of stress on cognition.

Intelligence Agency Subversion of the Arts

Dudley Cocke, Roadside Theater, 'Styles' - Susan Sontag,
Grantmakers in the Arts Reader, 2001 --
http://www.roadside.org/styles.html
In response to CIA funding of the Partisan Review, Cocke writes:
...What was the Agency buying? Perhaps it was an arts world restricted to
valorizing beauty, an arts and letters where multiple ideas about truth would
be discouraged from surfacing.
Sontag's quoted words in this article should be taken in the context
of the time when they were written and do not even necessarily apply to her later
work. I have in our time heard it expressed that art should only address political
issues. From my point of view, the point is not what a respected
artist said overtly -- artists say many things during the course of their lifetimes
-- but that any aesthetic criteria held by intelligence agencies covertly infiltrating
the arts could dictate what art is shown and what is not,
and because the influence is covert, that would be a serious impingement on freedom
of expression in the arts.

The same is true in the sciences where covert influence and funding could
negatively effect the work of scientists and researchers who do not pursue
defense-oriented research.

Covert CIA funding of selected artists -- extensively documented in this book--
put some artists, writers, and musicians in the position of having no idea
that their work was unknowingly supported by the CIA. Furthermore, the CIA
control of culture documented in this book, while it may have had some
benefits in the abstract-expressionist era, may also have put in place a mechanism
for CIA interference in the arts -- in later eras when art and art forms,
such as performance art, new media, and e-literature became more challenging
both to the political establishment and to critics whose aesthetics
were formed in era of abstract expressionism.

George L. Hersey, Evolution of Allure, Sexual Selection
from the Medici Venus to the Incredible Hulk, Cambridge, MA:
MIT Press, 1996.

Of particular interest in this book by Yale art historian George Hersey,
is the description of British eugenicist Francis Galton's program for breeding
by superior families only; (pp 110-111) Cesare Lombroso's
denial of the equality of women in his prescription for sexual selection;
(pp 112-123) Max Nordau's attacks specifically on artists and his suggestion
that artists and other such personalities should be confined to camps where they
would be under constant supervision and would not be allowed
to reproduce; (p. 144) and the attacks of Nordau and proto-Nazi
Paul Schultze-Naumburg on art and artists.

Appearing in 1996, Evolution of Allure is of interest
in that, at the height of the culture wars,
it reveals historical antecedents for a series of systems not only for
eugenics breeding but also for the persecution of artists.

...Helms' systematic attacks on individual artists focused national attention
not on the myriad creative approaches of this country's artists and the compelling
need for their support -- but rather on the narrow-minded prejudices of the attackers.
The Arts Endowment was under continual threat of elimination. The National arts budget
was drastically slashed. Content restrictions were imposed on government grants.

Celebrating many of the innovative individuals who (with little financial
compensation) have dedicated their lives to art making, an NEA Artist's Fellowship
was a meaningful award for this country's artists to strive for. But in the summer
of 1995, Congress eliminated grants to all individual artists, with the exception
of writers and jazz masters....

Memo from convicted Nazi War Criminal Otto Ambros, who was hired as
a consultant by WR Grace, Dow, and the US Army Chemical Corps:
...We have furthermore drawn the attention of the concentration camp
to the fact that, in the last few weeks, the inmates are being severely flogged
on the construction site by the Capos in increasing measure, and this always
applies to the weakest inmates who really cannot work harder. The exceedingly
unpleasant scenes that occur on the construction site because of this
are beginning to have a demoralizing effect on the free workers (Poles),
as well as on the Germans. We have therefore asked that they should refrain
from carrying out this flogging on the construction site and transfer it to
the inside of the concentration camp. (note that this memo is currently

Nathan Leites and Charles Wolf, Jr., Rebellion and Authority,
Chicago, Markham Publishing Company, 1970. A RAND Corporation Research Study
Through anecdotes and unsubstantiated evidence, Leites and Wolf present a picture
that advocates rational choice (hurting people so that they will conform)
as opposed to constructive choice. (making life better for better)
Given that Rand was influential in formulating Vietnam era policy,
of particular interest is Chapter 6: Inflicting Damage, pp 90-131.

Max Nordau, Degeneration, Lincoln and London, University
of Nebraska Press, 1993. (reprinted from the English langauage edition,
NY: D. Appleton & Co, 1895; original German edition: 1892)

On page 326, Nordau, speaking of work that he considers ugly or loathsome,
states Ought we not in this case to condemn the work and if possible to
suppress it? How can its right to exist be justified?

After comparing artists to drunks and criminals, who should forcefully put
under Guardianship, he writes: It never occurs to us to permit the criminal
by organic disposition to 'expand' his individually in crime, and just as
little can it be expected of us to permit the degenerate artist to expand his
individuality in immoral works of art. (p. 326)

Among the artists Nordau considers degenerate are the impressionist
painters, (p. 27) Zola, (pp. 489-506) Tolstoi (pp. 144-171) and Ibsen.
pp. 338-415) After calling Ibsen a poet of great verve and power, he then
spends over 50 pages attempting to prove that Ibsen's works are degenerate,
finally emphasizing that Ibsen is immoral because of his strong women
characters: Under Ibsen's code of morals the vast majority of wives would
have everything to lose. The severe discipline of matrimony is their bulwark... (p. 415)

In addition to works which empower women or might influence them, Nordau
also rants against new forms. The art and poetry of to-morrow, in all
essential points, will be the art and poetry of to-day and yesterday, and
the spasmodic seeking for new forms is nothing more than hysterical vanity,
the freaks of strolling players and charlatanism. (p. 544)

Nordau's method is that of the hell and brimstone preacher who himself sees
the seductive beauty of pleasure and therefore violently condemns it.
For instance, on pages 127-128, there is a progression from
the beauty of Verlaine's poetry to an attack on Verlaine in which Nordau calls
Verlaine a repulsive degenerate and an emotional dreamer of feeble intellect and
speaks of his incoherent speech, meaningless expressions, and motley images.

Thus in 560 pages in which the beauty of art is turned into a venomous diatribe
against artists, Max Nordau, who was very influential at the time of the writing
of this book, sets the stage for the Culture Wars repression of artists and their
work, proposing a Society for Ethical Culture to brand immoral works. (p. 558)

Speaking of artists whom he considers degenerate, in the concluding pages,
Nordau writes: Mystics, but especially ego-maniacs and filthy pseudo-realists,
are enemies to society of the direst kind. Society must unconditionally defend
itself against them. Whoever believes with me that society is the natural
organic form of humanity, in which alone it can exist, prosper and continue
to develop itself to higher destinies; whoever looks upon civilization as a
good, having value and deserving to be defended, must mercilessly crush under

Eric Adler, Missourian played key role in old-time eugenics
movement, The Kansas City Star, April 27, 2002 --
...It was Laughlin, too, who in 1924 would be instrumental
in altering the ethnic make-up of the United States. As Congress'
chosen 'expert eugenics agent,' he offered 'scientific' testimony
as to why the United States should pass the Immigration Restriction
Act..Used in part to deny access to thousands of European Jews
hoping to escape Nazi Germany, the law endured until the 1960s...

...His model sterilization laws were used by many of the more than 30
states that passed sterilization laws. Germany's 1933 sterilization laws were
also modeled after Laughlin's. Laughlin's immigration studies, which
seemed to support the idea that recent immigrants from Southern and
Eastern Europe had a higher percentage of socially inadequate persons
than other immigrants, led to the highly restrictive immigration quota
system of 1924 which favored immigrants from Northern Europe...

Operation Paperclip

Linda Hunt, Secret Agenda, The United States Government, Nazi
Scientists, and Project Paperclip, 1945-1990. St. Martin's Press, 1991.
(out of print)
A comprehensive account that documents the bringing to this country
of about 1000 Nazi scientists and researchers under Operation Paperclip,
which recruited Nazi war criminals. Hunt documents how Werner von Braun
and his team were sent to Huntsville and von Braun became the first director
of the Marshall Space Flight Center; how Kurt Debus, Peenemunde's V-2 flight
director, became the first director of NASA's Kennedy Center;
and how Arthur Rudolph, who drove and murdered slaves,
became the project director for NASA's Saturn IV rocket program
that took the U.S. to the moon.

Linda Hunt also establishes that the Operation Paperclip program
continued under various names (National Interest; Project 63) through 1990.
As regards Project 63, she writes: Thus the American taxpayer footed
the bill for a project to help former Nazis obtain jobs with Lockheed,
Martin Marietta, North American Aviation or other defense contractors
during a time when many American engineers in the aircraft industry were
being laid off. (p. 176)

Apollo 204 Review Board, Final Reports, April 5, 1967 --
http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollo204/content.html
(Report of Apollo 204 Review Board, NASA Historical Reference Collection,
NASA History Office, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC.)

The Findings, Determinations and Recommendations in the report of
the 1967 fire that killed Grissom, White, and Chaffee stated that:

Those organizations responsible for the planning, conduct and safety of this test failed
to identify it as being hazardous. Contingency preparations to permit escape or rescue of the
crew from an internal Command Module fire were not made.
*No procedures for this type of emergency had been established either for the
crew or for the spacecraft pad work team.
*The emergency equipment located in the White Room and on the spacecraft work levels
was not designed for the smoke condition resulting from a fire of this nature.
*Emergency fire, rescue and medical teams were not in attendance.
*Both the spacecraft work levels and the umbilical tower access arm contain
features such as steps, sliding doors and sharp turns in the egress paths
which hinder emergency operations.

Adequate safety precautions were neither established nor observed for this test.

According to Linda Hunt, (Secret Agenda, pp 223) there is evidence
that Kurt Debus, who was Director of the Kennedy Space Center, was negligent both in approving
the mission and in not seeing that adequate fire fighting equipment was on hand.
Debus had been an engineer at the Nazi missile factory at Peenemunde.

Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feymann observes that the
discrepencies between NASA pr and the reality of chances of failure,
stating that It would appear that, for whatever purpose, be it for internal
or external consumption, the management of NASA exaggerates the
reliability of its product, to the point of fantasy.


Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, June 6th,
1986 Washington, D.C.
-- http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/genindex.htm
In the section titled An Accident Rooted in History , the Commission
states that: The Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Booster problem began
with the faulty design of its joint and increased as both NASA and contractor
management first failed to recognize it as a problem,
then failed to fix it and finally treated it as an acceptable flight risk.

Morton Thiokol, Inc., the contractor, did not accept the implication
of tests early in the program that the design had a serious and
unanticipated flaw. NASA did not accept the judgment of its engineers
that the design was unacceptable, and as the joint problems grew in
number and severity NASA minimized them in management briefings and reports.
