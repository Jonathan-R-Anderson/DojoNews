China is potentially an important global trader of agricultural commodities, a role that will become more pronounced following the country's World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. At various times during the 1990s, China imported as much as 17 percent of the world's traded wheat, 25 percent of its fertilizer, and 28 percent of its soybean oil, while exporting as much as 10 percent of the world's traded corn. China's role in global agricultural trade has been modest, and the country has run small annual agricultural trade surpluses in recent years (fig. H-1). 1 Since 1980, agricultural trade has grown slowly in comparison with China's surging merchandise trade (fig. H-2). The nominal value of China's total merchandise exports and imports grew at annual rates of about 13 percent from 1980 to 1999 (World Bank). Agricultural exports and imports grew considerably slower, at average annual rates of 6.6 percent (exports) and 5.0 percent (imports). Growth in the real value of Shift Toward Comparative Advantage Broadly speaking, the rationale for freer international trade lies in the efficiency gains that a country enjoys through using resources most efficiently by specializing in production in certain goods and trading these goods in world markets. Specialization according to comparative advantage means that a country produces commodities that are best suited to the country's resource endowment, and this raises national income. A shift toward freer trade may provide added sidebenefits from scale economies and increased domestic competition. With an abundant rural labor force relative to its land base, China has a comparative advantage in labor-intensive agricultural products, such as fruits and vegetables, and manufactured agricultural products. However, agricultural policy in China and trade barriers in other parts of the world have tilted China's agricultural production away from its comparative advantage.
