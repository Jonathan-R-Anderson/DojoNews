Courts have discretion to allow proceeding anonymously where the need for

privacy outweighs the public’s interest in knowing their identity and any prejudice to the
defendants. Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 189 (2d Cir. 2008). This
litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and identification of
Plaintiff would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to her and to others. Exh. A. All of the
ten factors that the Second Circuit articulated as relevant to this analysis favor anonymity,
especially factors 1-4, 7, and 10 (e.g., factors one and two: “whether the litigation involves
matters that are ‘highly sensitive and [of a] personal nature,’” and “’whether identification poses
a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the ... party [seeking to proceed anonymously] or

even more critically, to innocent non-parties’”.), or are neutral with respect to anonymity.
Protecting Plaintiff’s anonymity is also appropriate as she is a rape victim.
9.

Plaintiff was enticed by promises of money and a modeling career to attend a

series of parties, with other similarly situated minor females, held at a New York City residence
that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. At least four of the parties were attended by
Defendant Trump. Exhs. A and B. On information and belief, by this time in 1994, Defendant
Trump had known Defendant Epstein for seven years (New York, 10/28/02, “’I've known Jeff for
fifteen years. Terrific guy,’' Trump booms from a speakerphone. ‘He's a lot of fun to be with. It
is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger
side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.’”), and knew that Plaintiff was then just
13 years old. Exhs. A and B.
10.

Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties.

On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff
to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the
course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but
with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in
the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Exhs. A and
B.
11.

Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened Plaintiff that, were

she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse of her by Defendant Trump,

The duress and coercion exerted by Defendants has been such as to have
actually deprived Plaintiff of her freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time, and it rose to
such a level that a person of reasonable firmness in Plaintiff's situation would have been unable
to resist. Exhs. A and B.
23.

Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man

and indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed,
Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear
like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with
Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was
capable of having her whole family killed. Exhs. A and B.
24.

The duress had prevented Plaintiff from starting litigation before this year.

However, as soon as she surfaced, she received threats. More specifically, shortly after her first
complaint was filed in California on April 26, 2016, she started receiving threatening phone calls
on her cell phone. Exh. A.
25.

Defendants are equitably estopped from arguing that any statute of limitations has

not been tolled as Defendants wrongfully forced Plaintiff to refrain from timely commencing this
action by threats, duress, and other misconduct. Exhs. A and B. Zimmerman v. Poly Prep
Country Day School, ___ F.Supp.2d ___ (2012), 2012 WL 3683393; General Stencils, Inc. v.
Chippa, 18 N.Y.2d 125, 127 (1966)(“a wrongdoer should not be able to take refuge behind the
shield of his own wrongdoing.”).

26.

Moreover, this action has been brought before the facts giving rise to the estoppel

have ceased to be operational (i.e., while still under threats of physical harm by coming forward
and having no reason to believe that the threats have ever been lifted or would ever be lifted) and
since Plaintiff has decided to seek redress at this time, Plaintiff seeks an order of protection in
favor of Plaintiff and all associated with her so as to protect them from harm a
