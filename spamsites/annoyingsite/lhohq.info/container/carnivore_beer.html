<title>The total collapse of WTC 7 at 5:20 PM on 9/11 was remarkable because it exemplified all the sig-
nature features of an implosion: The building dropped
in absolute free fall for the first 2.25 seconds of its de-
scent over a distance of 32 meters or eight stories [3]. Its
transition from stasis to free fall was sudden, occurring
in approximately one-half second. It fell symmetrically
straight down. Its steel frame was almost entirely dis-
membered and deposited mostly inside the building's
footprint, while most of its concrete was pulverized into
tiny particles. Finally, the collapse was rapid, occurring
in less than seven seconds.
Given the nature of the collapse, any investigation
adhering to the scientific method should have seriously
considered the controlled demolition hypothesis, if not
started with it. Instead, NIST (as well as the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency (FEMA), which conducted a
preliminary study prior to the NIST investigation) began
with the predetermined conclusion that the collapse was
caused by fires.
Trying to prove this predetermined conclusion was
apparently difficult. FEMA's nine-month study concluded
by saying, 'The specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how
they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at
this time. Although the total diesel fuel on the premises
contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis
has only a low probability of occurrence.' NIST, mean-
while, had to postpone the release of its WTC 7 report
from mid-2005 to November 2008. As late as March 2006,
NIST's lead investigator, Dr. Shyam Sunder, was quoted as
saying, 'Truthfully, I don't really know. We've had trouble
getting a handle on building No. 7.'
All the while, NIST was steadfast in ignoring evi-
dence that conflicted with its predetermined conclusion.
The most notable example was its attempt to deny that
24 EPN 47/4
WTC 7 underwent free fall. When pressed about that
matter during a technical briefing, Dr. Sunder dismissed
it by saying, '[A] free-fall time would be an object that
has no structural components below it.' But in the case
of WTC 7, he claimed, 'there was structural resistance
that was provided.' Only after being challenged by high
school physics teacher David Chandler and by physics
professor Steven Jones (one of the authors of this article),
who had measured the fall on video, did NIST acknowl-
edge a 2.25-second period of free fall in its final report. Yet
NIST's computer model shows no such period of free fall,
nor did NIST attempt to explain how WTC 7 could have
had 'no structural components below it' for eight stories.
Instead, NIST's final report provides an elaborate sce-
nario involving an unprecedented failure mechanism: the
thermal expansion of floor beams pushing an adjoin-
ing girder off its seat. The alleged walk-off of this girder
then supposedly caused an eight-floor cascade of floor
failures, which, combined with the failure of two other
girder connections-also due to thermal expansion-left
a key column unsupported over nine stories, causing it to
buckle. This single column failure allegedly precipitated
the collapse of the entire interior structure, leaving the
exterior unsupported as a hollow shell. The exterior col-
umns then allegedly buckled over a two-second period
and the entire exterior fell simultaneously as a unit [3].
NIST was able to arrive at this scenario only by omit-
ting or misrepresenting critical structural features in its
computer modelling.[4] Correcting just one of these
errors renders NIST's collapse initiation indisputably
impossible. Yet even with errors that were favorable to
its predetermined conclusion, NIST's computer model
(see Fig. 3) fails to replicate the observed collapse, instead
showing large deformations to the exterior that are not
observed in the videos and showing no period of free
fall. Also, the model terminates, without explanation,
less than two seconds into the seven-second collapse.
Unfortunately, NIST's computer modelling cannot be
independently verified because NIST has refused to re-
lease a large portion of its modelling data on the basis
that doing so 'might jeopardize public safety.'</title>

WHEN a Republican member of the House arose to move the usual adjournment for the holidays, there was a storm of hisses and cries of 'No, no !' Said the leader of the House, amid deafening plaudits: ' VVe are the servants of the people. Our work is not yet complete. There must be no play for us while coal barons stand with their feet on the ashes of the poor man's hearthstone, and weeds and thorns cumber the ﬁelds of the farmer for lack of money to buy seed and implements. There must be no play for us while railway magnates press from the pockets of the laboring man six and eight per cent. return on thrice watered stocks, and rapacious land- lords, enriched by inheritance, grind the faces of the poor. There must be no play for us while enemies of the human kind are, by means of trust and com- bination and ' corners,' engaged in drawing their un- ' holy millions from the very life-blood of the nation, paralyzing its best efforts and setting the blight of intemperance and indifference upon it, by making life but one long struggle for existence, without a gleam of rest and comfort in old age. No, Mr. Speaker, we must not adjourn, but by our efforts in these halls of legislation let the nation know that we are at work for its emancipation, and by these means let the monopolists and money-changers be brought to a realizing sense that the Reign of the Common People has really been entered upon, and then the 24

 By proclamation bearing date the 5th day of March I891, the President summoned both houses of Con- gress to convene in extraordinary session “for the consideration of the general welfare of the United States, and to take such action as might seem neces- sary and expedient to them on certain measures which he should recommend to their consideration, _measures of vital import to the welfare and happiness of the people, if not to the very existence of the Union and the continuance of their enjoyment of the liberties achieved by the fathers of the Republic.' While awaiting the day set for the coming together of the Congress, the “Great Friend of the Common People' came suddenly face to face with the ﬁrst serious business of his Administration. Fifty thou- sand people tramped the streets of Washington without bread or shelter. Many had come in quest of oﬂice, lured on by the solemn pronouncement of their candidate that there should be at once a clean sweep of these barnacles of the ship of State and so complete had been their conﬁdence in their glorious young captain, that they had literally failed to pro- , vide themselves with either ' urse or scri tor shoes ' ,_ ow , and now stood hungiy and footsore at his gate, beg- ging for a crust of bread.
