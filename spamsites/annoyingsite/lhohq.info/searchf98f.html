ell acquainted with [deletion] and was pleased to offer for him a similar recommendation.
		
		If you think this is a good idea, I suggest you sign the Joint Account Agreement and the three signature cards enclosed and return them to me.
		
		And now that the account is opened I suggest you have funds deposited via Cashier's check -- or any other way that seems easiest -- directly to [deleted] account.
		
		I ordered checks printed with [deleted] name thereon and have also ordered stationary bearing [deleted] name. I considered this might facilitate payment of bills, etc., by mail.
		
		What with suspicious banks, landlords, utility companies, etc., you will understand that creating the Jekyll-Hyde personality in the form of [deleted] is taking a little "doing".
		
		See you Monday, the 8th

		MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
		
		SUBJECT: Project MKULTRA, Subproject 23
		
		
		1. The scope of this project is intended to encompass all those activities now engaged in by the [deleted] in its own facilities under the direction of CD/TSS. At the present time the various projects at this facility ([deleted] and [deleted]) are being concluded and it is deemed desirable from the standpoint of security and efficiency to replace these projects with a single project more general in its approach.
		
		2. The attached proposal from Dr. [deleted] indicates the extent of the investigations that his facilities will allow him to carry out on the materials developed in the three projects referred to in paragraph 1, as well as certain other materials of interest to Cd/TSS. Dr. [deleted] also serves as a general consultant to this division and provides cover and cut-out facilities to the Agency.
		
		3. The total cost of this project for a period of one year will not exceed $42,700.00.
		
		4. Dr. [deleted] has been granted a Top Secret Clearance by the Agency and is fully capable of projecting the security of the Government's interest in such matters as this.

ambassadors and special envoys, but at the usual entertainments given to
the public or to the official family he was seldom seen. He and Gloria
were in accord, regarding the character of entertainments to be given,
and all unnecessary display was to be avoided. This struck a cruel blow
at Mrs. Strawn, who desired to have everything in as sumptuous a way as
under the old regime, but both Dru and Gloria were as adamant, and she
had to be content with the new order of things.

"Gloria," said Dru, "it pleases me beyond measure to find ourselves so
nearly in accord concerning the essential things, and I am glad to
believe that you express your convictions candidly and are not merely
trying to please me."

"That, Philip, is because we are largely striving for the same purposes.
We both want, I think, to take the selfish equation out of our social
fabric. We want to take away the sting from poverty, and we want envy to
have no place in the world of our making. Is it not so?"

"That seems to me, Gloria, to be the crux of our endeavors. But when we
speak of unselfishness, as we now have it in mind, we are entering a

The HNeT library facilitates the integration of neuron cells into both simple and
highly elaborate neuromorphic assembly structures. The HNeT library permits
allocation of up to 64K assemblies per program instance. The HNeT library
provides integration of the seven primary neuron cell types listed below:
Principle Cell Types
Receptor
Granule
Pyramidal
Stellate
Purkinje
Hippocampal (temporal)
Axonal and collateral signal routing
Cell Morphology
The primary assembly structures provided within the HNeT system are illustrated
below for the cerebellar and neo-cortical models. The HNeT library provides an
array of functions for customization of individual cell architectures, cell assembly
architectures, synaptic interconnectivity, neural plasticity (synaptic pruning and
regrowth), customization of supervised, unsupervised, spatial-temporal and
hyper-incursive neural models, data conversion and preprocessing. A function
reference sheet for the HNeT API language is available upon request.



Principle Assembly Structures
Cerebellar Model
Cerebellar
Neo-cortical
Spatial-tem
Recursive
Hyper incursive
Composite (mixed)
Neo-Cortical Model
HNeT technology provides an exceptionally high "connection per second" or CPS
rating; in excess of 200 Million CPS on Pentium IV processors. This allows the
system to learn and/or respond to several millions of input patterns per second.
Advanced features of neural plasticity are provided. Neural plasticity allows the
HNeT system to optimize and reconfigure cell assembly structures and synaptic
interconnections in an automated manner.
An extensive library of conversion formats are provided for orthogonalization of
input data streams, including histogram normalization, Fourier, Gabor and wavelet
transforms. Custom algorithms may be integrated as post-processing transforms
within HNeT cells.
Permits dynamic (on line) modification of virtually all cell properties such as
synaptic and axonal interconnection, neural plasticity, cortical memory, learning
rate, execution sequence, etc.
