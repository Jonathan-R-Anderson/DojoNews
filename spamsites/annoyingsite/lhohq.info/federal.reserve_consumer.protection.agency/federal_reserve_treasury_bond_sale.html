<h1>II. Summary of Program Changes</h1>

<h2>mirqlkljvW=q^hb=^klqebo=illh=</h2>
The latest Survey of Consumer Finance data was released Friday 24th of February. It shows that the rich in the US continue to be in great shape. We thought this was good time to bang the drum on plutonomy.
Back in October, we coined the term ‘Plutonomy’ (The Global Investigator, Plutonomy: Buying Luxury, Explaining Global Imbalances, October 14 2005). Our thesis is that the rich are the dominant drivers of demand in many economies around the world (the US, UK, Canada and Australia). These economies have seen the rich take an increasing share of income and wealth over the last 20 years, to the extent that the rich now dominate income, wealth and spending in these countries. Asset booms, a rising profit share and favorable treatment by market-friendly governments have allowed the rich to prosper and become a greater share of the economy in the plutonomy countries.

Also, new media dissemination technologies like internet downloading, cable and satellite TV, have disproportionately increased the audiences, and hence gains to “superstars” – think golf, soccer, and baseball players, music/TV and movie icons, fashion models, designers, celebrity chefs etc. These “content” providers, the tech whizzes who own the pipes and distribution, the lawyers and bankers who intermediate globalization and productivity, the CEOs who lead the charge in converting globalization and technology to increase the profit share of the economy at the expense of labor, all contribute to pornography.

Properties and mechanisms of perceptual priming
Cheri L Wiggs and Alex Martin ∗
Recent evidence suggests that the behavioral phenomenon of
perceptual priming and the physiological finding of decreased
neural responses with item repetition have similar properties.
Both the behavioral and neurophysiological effects show
graded changes with multiple repetitions, are resistant to
manipulations of particular stimulus attributes (e.g. size and
location), and occur independently of awareness. These and
other recent findings (e.g. from functional brain imaging in
humans) suggest that perceptual priming may be mediated
by decreased neural responses associated with perceptual
learning.
and neurological research in humans, that has examined
neural mechanisms for priming. The scope of this review
is limited to visual perceptual priming; we will not
address issues related to semantic priming, procedural
tasks (e.g. pursuit rotor task), priming in other modalities
(e.g. auditory, haptic), or conceptual priming tasks that
do not involve visual processes (e.g. category exemplar
production task). We do, however, include reports of tasks
that are primarily perceptual but may include a conceptual
component (e.g. stem completion [7 •• ]).

Introduction
Perceiving and identifying an object or word is improved
by experience with that object or word. For instance,
people typically have lower perceptual identification
thresholds for repeated stimuli, and are faster and more
accurate at naming or reading repeated stimuli compared
with new stimuli [1]. This nonconscious form of memory,
referred to as perceptual priming, has motivated a large
body of research aimed at revealing the phenomenon’s
underpinnings. By and large, unique properties have been
attributed to perceptual priming, suggesting that it may
reflect a distinct memory system. A particularly important
finding is that perceptual priming is preserved in amnesia,
despite patients’ devastating impairments on explicit tests
of episodic memory (i.e. tests, such as recognition or
recall, that require conscious recollection of information
tied to a specific context; see [2 • ] for a recent report).
This dissociation provides key evidence for the existence
of multiple memory systems [3,4], although this view is
not without its opponents [5,6 • ].
In this review, we summarize current data indicating that
perceptual priming operates according to rules distinct
from episodic memory. We begin by reviewing recent
advances in documenting the general behavioral properties
of perceptual priming, including how these properties are
affected over the life span. We then turn to neurophy-
siological research in animals, as well as neuroimaging
Although previous reviews have described general prop-
erties of priming (e.g. [8]), recent findings have expanded
the boundaries of these properties. For instance, it has long
been noted that, whereas retention on standard explicit
memory tests typically declines with the passage of time
[9], perceptual priming effects are long-lasting in normal
adults [10,11] and amnesic patients [12,13]. Recently,
Cave [14 •• ] documented that perceptual priming can be
detected on an object-naming task after as much as a
48 week delay between the first and second exposure of
an item. Although priming diminished as delays increased,
it remained significant, even in subjects who performed
at chance on recognition. Thus, even with chance-level
performance on explicit tests, priming can still be detected
in normal subjects. These results imply that performance
on priming and explicit tasks is independent.
Recent findings have not only expanded the boundaries of
perceptual priming, but, in some cases, have also altered
the previous conception of what these properties are.
Although perceptual priming has been characterized as ‘all
or none’ [10], recent evidence suggests it is incremental
and can be modulated by the number of repetitions. The
amount of priming increases with multiple repetitions,
and this advantage remains over week-long delays [15].
The percent decline over one week (relative to delays
of several minutes) is less after multiple repetitions than
for single exposures of stimuli. Moreover, priming is
sensitive to the actual number of repetitions [16,17 • ]. That
is, the magnitude of priming increases significantly with
each additional exposure to a stimulus. This finding is
in line with performance on explicit tests of memory,
as subjects are generally accurate in judging how often
an event occurred [18]. However, the graded nature of
priming is reliable, even in patients who are unable to
remember the stimuli or judge frequency on explicit tests
[17 • ]. These findings suggest that a mechanism exists that
automatically monitors how often an item repeats and that
this mechanism operates outside of conscious awareness.
Perceptual priming is sensitive to changes in physical
appearance in some instances, but not others. In general,228
Cognitive neuroscience
alterations made in stimulus attributes (e.g. color, pattern,
luminance, contrast, location, left–right reflection, and
size) impair performance on explicit tests [19–22], but
priming tends to be similar whether the stimuli are
changed or unchanged from one presentation to another
([19–24]; but see [25]). At the same time, perceptual
priming can be attenuated when stimuli are changed
so as to affect the ability to identify stimulus form.
Specifically, priming is not affected by relatively small
changes in orientation (i.e. rotations in depth up to
67 ̊) but is eliminated by large changes in orientation
(i.e. rotations in depth ≥ 80 ̊) [26]. Furthermore, priming is
diminished (but still present) with changes in an object’s
exemplar (i.e. a different picture of the same-named
object) [23,24], and with changes in a word’s typography
[27–29] from study to test. These results suggest that
physical attributes that are not essential to the formation
of a shape representation (e.g. color) do not influence
perceptual priming. In contrast, physical attributes that are
essential to the representation of object form (e.g. line
elements of drawings) or written word form (e.g. print
typography of letters) do influence perceptual priming.
Perceptual priming is typically unaffected by the same
interference manipulations that impair episodic memory
on explicit tests. It is well established that attention
is beneficial, if not essential, for successfully retrieving
information on explicit tests of memory (see e.g. [30]).
Yet, the degree of attention devoted to encoding typically
does not affect the magnitude of priming. Thus, when
attention is divided during encoding, priming is no
different than when attention is focused [31]. Priming
is as strong following the presentation of irrelevant
information (i.e. information eliciting little attention) than
following the presentation of information to which subjects
attend [32].
Perhaps even more striking are reports of perceptual
priming in the absence of conscious perception. Intact
priming has been reported for information presented
auditorily during anesthesia [33]. Bar and Biederman [34 • ]
extended such findings to the visual domain. Subjects
were shown line drawings of objects that were masked
to produce very low levels of identification accuracy.
When the same objects were shown a second time,
identification accuracy increased significantly, even though
recognition memory for those objects was at chance. This
phenomenon, however, occurred only for stimuli that were
physically identical to the stimuli presented previously.
Counter to the evidence reviewed earlier, changing the
location of the object reduced (but did not eliminate)
priming. Moreover, priming was extinguished when the
object presented at test had the same name as, but a
different physical form than, the object presented at study.
These data suggest that perceptual priming does not
require the same degree of encoding as do explicit tests
of memory. Nevertheless, attentional manipulations can
impair perceptual priming under certain conditions. In
particular, some minimal level of attention at encoding
must be attained for priming to occur [35]. Furthermore,
where attention is directed when an item recurs can affect
the degree of priming. For instance, MacLeod [36] asked
subjects to study words and later measured priming on
two tasks: one required subjects to read words (ignoring
the print color of the words), whereas the other required
subjects to name the print color of the words (ignoring the
words). Priming occurred for the word reading task but not
the color naming task. Thus, in this case, reading a word at
study facilitated reading that word again at test, but did not
affect performance on a test in which reading the word was
irrelevant (i.e. color naming). Thus, perceptual priming
reflects an interplay between the processes required when
first encoding an item and when it repeats. If a previously
encoded item is not in the focus of attention when it
reappears, and is unnecessary to accomplish the task
at hand, the fact that it was recently processed is not
influential.
Developmental course of priming
Given that the properties of perceptual priming are
distinct from those of episodic memory in young adults,
do priming and episodic memory also have different
developmental courses? Infants once were believed to
have only a single primitive memory system (priming),
with episodic memory unfolding later in development
[37]. However, current evidence suggests that many of the
nonverbal tests used with infants in fact measure rudimen-
tary forms of episodic memory. This new interpretation is
attributable to two general findings. First, developmental
changes (e.g. longer retention spans, increased memory
capacity) have been found in infant memory paradigms,
such as conditioning [38 •• ], object search paradigms [39],
and deferred imitation [40]. Second, amnesic patients are
impaired on some of these same tasks [37,41].
What, then, in infants, reflects the perceptual priming
phenomena found in adults? Researchers have attempted
to measure an analog of priming in pre-verbal infants
[38 •• ,42]; however, the paradigms are quite different from
those used with adults. Hence, interpretation of these data
is problematic. Although limitations in the experimental
methods available for infants have made it difficult to
study perceptual priming in infants, data for older children
come from paradigms that mirror those used with adults,
and thus are more comparable to the adult literature.
Typically, as children grow older, one sees improvement
on explicit tests of memory, but no changes in priming
[43]. Moreover, the properties of priming appear to remain
stable across the developmental time line. For instance,
similar to reports with adults, children show smaller but
significant priming effects after changes in an object’s
exemplar compared with same-item primes, and this effect
does not vary with the children’s age [44 • ].Properties and mechanisms of perceptual priming Wiggs and Martin
The effect of advancing age on performance in priming
and explicit tasks is that older adults are inferior to younger
adults on most explicit tasks of episodic memory, but,
in general, they do not differ from younger adults on
perceptual priming tasks (for reviews, see [45,46 • ]; but see
also [47]). Moreover, many of the properties of perceptual
priming remain intact. For example, priming in young and
elderly subjects shows similar incremental changes with
repetition [16] and similar attenuation with changes in
typography [29,48]. However, it remains to be determined
whether all properties are unaffected. For example, is
priming as long-lasting in the elderly as in the young?
Taken together, these studies suggest a pattern of memory
performance over the life span that depicts an inverted
U-shaped function for explicit tasks of episodic memory
and a relatively flat function for perceptual priming [49].
In other words, performance on explicit tasks initially
improves with age (in children), and then declines with
advancing age (in the elderly), but priming remains
relatively stable from age 3 to 80. These findings suggest
that the systems subserving perceptual priming and
episodic memory have distinct developmental trends over
the life span. Nevertheless, more work is needed to
establish whether all properties are conserved over the life
span.
A neural mechanism for perceptual priming
The behavioral data reviewed above suggest that percep-
tual priming and episodic memory depend on different
memory systems in the brain. What has been lacking,
however, is evidence that each type of memory system
is associated with different types of neural mechanisms.
Recent data from single-cell recordings from monkey cor-
tex, functional brain imaging and event-related potential
(ERP) studies of normal human subjects, and behavioral
studies of brain-damaged humans, provide converging
evidence about the neural mechanism that mediates
perceptual priming. These data provide a biological basis
for distinguishing priming from other forms of memory.
Repetition suppression
In 1987, Brown et al. [50] and Baylis and Rolls [51]
reported that some neurons in the monkey’s ventral tem-
poral lobe had a reduced response to the re-presentation
of a stimulus, but not to the presentation of novel items.
Since then, several studies have appeared that have begun
to define the properties of this ‘repetition suppression’
effect (for recent reviews, see [52 •• ,53 • ]):
1. Approximately a quarter [53 • ] to one-third [54] of infe-
rior temporal lobe neurons show repetition suppression.
2. Although repetition suppression has been recorded
most often from the inferior temporal cortex (including
area TE, perirhinal, and entorhinal cortex) [55,56 • ], the
phenomenon has also been observed in other regions
(e.g. prefrontal cortex) [57 • ].
229
3. Repetition suppression is stimulus specific, occurring
even when a large number of items (> 150) intervene
between repeated presentations of an item [58].
4. Repetition suppression appears to be long-lasting.
Neurons show a reduced response to the re-presentation
of a specific item with delays of up to 24 hours (the longest
delay tested) [59].
5. Repetition suppression is graded. Neurons show a
continual reduction in firing rate with each presentation,
up to six to eight repetitions, after which the response
plateaus to approximately 40% of its initial firing rate [58].
Thus, the response continues to reduce as the stimulus
becomes more familiar.
6. Repetition suppression survives object transformations
of size and location, suggesting that it operates on a
relatively abstract structural representation [60].
7. Repetition suppression can be recorded during passive
fixation [61], under anesthesia [62], and after cholinergic
blockade [63], suggesting that it is an automatic, intrinsic
response of cortical neurons.
8. The onset of repetition suppression can be very short,
occurring approximately 100 ms after the onset of the
initial neural response for a repeated item, and in as little
as 10 ms after the third repetition of an item [58].
9. Repetition suppression occurs when an item is re-
peated, regardless of its behavioral significance. Miller
and Desimone [64] studied working memory using a
delayed matching-to-sample task in which some of the
distractor items, presented during the interval between
the first and second presentation of the target item, also
repeated. Under these conditions, repetition suppression
was associated with item repetition, regardless of whether
the repeated item was a distractor or the target. Therefore,
repetition suppression did not convey information about
a specific item that was behaviorally significant (i.e. the
item that the monkey had to respond to in order to
obtain a reward). In contrast, another population of cells
showed the opposite response: an enhanced response to
item repetition. Critically, this enhanced response occurred
only when the target items, not the distractor items,
were repeated, suggesting that these neurons conveyed
information about the behaviorally relevant item.
These properties of repetition suppression mirror many
of the salient behavioral characteristics of perceptual
priming (e.g. it is long-lasting, shows a graded response,
and is resistant to manipulations of particular stimulus
attributes and awareness). These parallels suggest that
repetition suppression is a good candidate for the mech-
anism mediating perceptual priming. Indeed, supporting
evidence for this idea has come from human neuroimaging
studies, which have documented an association between230

Illustration of the changes in a neuronal network representing visual object features as a function of repeated experience. As an object is
presented repeatedly, neurons coding features that are not essential for recognizing the object decrease their responses (from black to gray
to white), thereby weakening connections with other neurons in the ensemble (from black, to open lines, to no lines). As a result, the network
becomes both sparser and more selective, yielding enhanced object identification.
perceptual priming and decreased neural activity (see
[7 •• ] for a recent review). Several studies using positron
emission tomography (PET) have reported reduced cere-
bral blood flow (and thus a reduced neural response)
associated with stem-completion priming [65–67]. In each
study, the reduction was observed in posterior ventral
occipitotemporal cortex (stronger on the right than on
the left). Reduced activity, however, was not limited to
this region, but was also reported (in one or more of the
studies) in insular, parietal, and prefrontal cortices, as well
as the thalamus and basal ganglia.
Similarly, using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), Demb et al. [68] found decreased activation in
left inferior prefrontal cortex (the only area they recorded
from) associated with the second presentation of words
relative to the first presentation. In a different study,
which used an object-naming task, our group (A Martin
et al., Soc Neurosci Abstr 1995, 21:1497) found that the
second presentation of objects was associated with reduced
activation relative to the first presentation of these same
objects. The level of activation returned to its initial
level when a novel set of objects was presented. The
reduced activity was not localized to one specific brain
region, but rather was present throughout all areas that
initially responded during the naming task, including the
ventral occipitotemporal region, and parietal, insular, and
prefrontal cortices.
Priming effects have also been studied using ERPs.
Consistent with the PET findings, two recent studies
reported a repetition-related reduction in the amplitude of
the ERP waveform that appeared within the first 200 ms
after stimulus onset, and was maximal over posterior
recording sites [69,70]. This reduction may reflect reduced
neural activity when items recur [70]. However, this
finding stands in marked contrast to several previous
reports of a repetition-related increase in the amplitude
of the ERP waveform (see [69] for a discussion of this
point). Additional studies are clearly needed to forge a
more direct link between repetition-related ERP effects,
repetition-related decreased activation in functional brain
imaging studies, and the behavioral characteristics of
perceptual priming. For example, are these brain-related
events impervious to manipulations of attention? Do they
survive delays of weeks and months?Properties and mechanisms of perceptual priming Wiggs and Martin
While single-cell recordings from monkey cortex and
human functional brain imaging studies have shown that
reduced activity is most common in, though not limited
to, temporal and occipital cortices, recent studies of brain-
damaged patients suggest that the occipitotemporal region
may be the critical site for mediating perceptual priming.
For example, a patient with a right occipital lobectomy
studied by Gabrieli and colleagues [71,72] had impaired
perceptual priming as measured by word identification
and stem-completion tasks. This finding is consistent
with the reduced activity in right occipitotemporal regions
reported in PET studies of stem-completion [65–67]
and with behavioral evidence [73] in normal subjects.
Importantly, the patient’s recognition memory for the same
words used in the priming studies was intact. However,
the patient was not impaired on all perceptual priming
tasks. For example, he showed normal facilitation on
an object-naming priming task (JDE Gabrieli et al., Soc
Neurosci Abstr 1994, 20:413). This suggests that the critical
brain region(s) mediating perceptual priming may vary
as a function of the specific priming task employed (for
additional evidence of impaired priming following damage
to the occipitotemporal region, see [74,75]).
Linking repetition suppression and behavioral
performance
Behaviorally, visual perceptual priming is defined by
improved processing of previously seen material, relative
to novel material (e.g. decreased naming times for an
object). How might this behavioral effect be linked to
reduced neuronal activity? A likely possibility, suggested
by Desimone [52 •• ], is that repeated experience with
a novel item leads to a sharpening of the stimulus
representation in the cortex (i.e. a representation of
the essential features needed to identify the object).
In this view, it is the neurons that continue to give a
robust response when items recur that carry the critical
information about the object. The neurons showing a
decreased response, on the other hand, are dropping out of
the responsive pool, perhaps because they encode features
not needed to identify that specific object (although,
presumably they would be critical for the identification
of other objects). Thus, repetition suppression is a
by-product of this sharpening process occurring in the
cortex. Experience leads to both a smaller representation
(with respect to the number of neurons maintaining their
response rate) and a more selective representation (limited
to critical stimulus-specific features that these neurons
encode) (Figure 1). This more selective, or sharpened,
representation would then result in a faster, more efficient,
behavioral response. Moreover, this process happens
automatically in the cortex. Repetition suppression is an
intrinsic property of cortical neurons, providing a form of
perceptual learning that allows us to identify previously
encountered objects quickly and efficiently.

Conclusions
Principles continue to emerge, supporting claims that
distinct memory systems underlie perceptual priming and
episodic memory. Perceptual priming is impervious to long
retention intervals, stimulus attribute alterations (e.g. size),
attentional manipulations (e.g. dividing attention), and
developmental changes, all of which affect episodic
memory.
Recent work has illuminated the neural mechanisms that
might underlie this phenomenon. One suggestion is that
perceptual priming is mediated by repetition suppression,
which appears to operate according to rules similar to
those that operate for priming. Moreover, decreased neural
activity has been reported in imaging studies using prim-
ing paradigms. These links, however, remain somewhat
speculative. Several lines of research will be useful to test
the degree to which characteristics between behavioral and
neurophysiological responses are the same. For instance,
how long does repetition suppression last (i.e. as long as
behavioral data imply)? Is repetition suppression sensitive
to changes in stimuli that affect the ability to identify
stimulus form (e.g. extreme changes in stimulus rotation
or different exemplars of the same-named object)? Is
repetition suppression sensitive to attentional manipula-
tions (as selective attention generally enhances neural
activity, see [76])? Is repetition suppression linked to
other forms of priming (e.g. semantic priming)? Are there
developmental changes seen in repetition suppression?
Moreover, it will be important to determine how different
priming paradigms are affected by lesions in different
cortical regions. Clarifying what properties collectively
define perceptual priming, and linking this phenomenon
with neural mechanisms, can be expected to have a pivotal
role in memory research.

Along with [5], this paper presents the theoretical view that priming effects
occur because the processes used to perform a task are ‘biased’ by prior
exposure to a stimulus. The bias effect is defined by data revealing that,
under certain conditions, there can be cognitive costs, rather than facilitation,
as a result of previous experience with an item.

In one of the few studies examining the effects of development on a specific
property of priming, the authors report no developmental changes (from 4 to
10 years of age) in the sensitivity of priming to alterations in stimulus form. All
age groups showed diminished (but significant) priming with changes in an
object’s exemplar, corroborating evidence found with adults, as presented in
[23,24]. This suggests that at least some of the properties of priming remain
stable throughout development.
