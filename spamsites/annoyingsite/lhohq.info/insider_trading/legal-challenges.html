<h2 style="float:left">CHARLES G. KOCH CHAIRMAN AND
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER</h2>

September 24, 20l0 

"If not us, who? If not now, when?"


That question was posed by a member of our network of business and philanthropic leaders, who are dedicated to defending our free society. We cannot rely on politicians to do so, so it is up to us to combat what is now the greatest assault on American freedom and prosperity in our lifetimes.

Twice a year our network meets to review strategies for combating the multitude of public policies that threaten to destroy America as we know it. These meetings have been critical in improving and expanding our efforts. p Our next meeting will be held January 30~3l, 2011, at the Rancho Las Palmas Resort in Rancho Mirage, California. 

You would be a valuable addition to our gathering, and we hope you can join us. '

In Palm Springs, we will assemble an exceptional group of leaders along with a strong line-up of speakers. Together, we will develop strategies to counter the most severe threats _facing our free society and outline a vision of how we can foster a renewal of American free enterprise and prosperity.
At our most recent meeting in Aspen, our group heard plans to activate citizens against the threat of government over-spending and to change the balance of power in Congress this November In response, participants committed to an unprecedented level of support. The important work being done with these initiatives continues. However, even if these efforts succeed, other serious threats demand action.
Everyone benefits from the prosperity that emerges from free societies. But that prosperity is under attack by the current Administration and many of our elected officials. Their policies threaten to erode our economic freedom and transfer vast sums of power to the state. We must stop A and reverse - this internal assault on our founding principles.

<h2 style="float:left">315.828.5201 Tel P.Cl. Box 2255 Wichita, Kansas 57201</h2>

?
Fighting back with incremental changes will only lead to a slower rate of decline. We must dedicate ourselves to making major advances in the direction of economic freedom. Our goal for these meetings must be to advance ideas that strengthen that freedom, beat back the unrelenting attacks and hold elected leaders accountable.
To give you a better idea of the nature of this event, I have enclosed the program from our Aspen meeting. While we will have great speakers and a beautiful setting, our ultimate goal is not &#8220;fun in the sun.&#8221; This is a gathering of doers who are willing to engage in the hard Work necessary to advance our shared principles. Success in this endeavor will require all the help we can muster.
W Your active participation would increase our probability of success during this pivotal time in our nation&#8217;s history. We hope to see you in Palm Springs, January 30-31.
Sincerely, 

At our seminars, we work to understand and address the threats to American free enterprise and prosperity. These meetings provide an opportunity to discuss these threats and the appropriate strategies to counter them. To that end, we focus on four main objectives:
&#176; Attracting principled leaders and investors who will effectively defend our free society &#176; Sharing best practices and opportunities to defend our free enterprise system from destructive public policies &#176; Fashioning the message and building the education channels to reestablish widespread belief in the benefits ofthe principles of a free and prosperous society &#176; Building principled, effective institutions that identify, educate and mobilize citizens in pursuit of a free and prosperous society Our seminars bring together business and philanthropic leaders who possess the vision and knowledge to develop innovative strategies to achieve results. The combination of knowledgeable speakers and motivated participants produces a dynamic environment that inspires creative approaches to advancing a free society.

<h1>The Threats to American Freedom and Prosperity</h2>
We are undergoing the greatest internal assault on American freedom and prosperity in our lifetimes.
Rather than cede ground to more government, we must strengthen economic freedom. Business leaders have an important role to play in promoting '
prosperity, countering the dangerous attacks on our founding principles, and reversing this trend.

Understanding the Persistent Threats We Face The current administration swept into office with a promise to &#8220;fundamentally transform America.&#8221;

power of unions, as Well as a push for major new climate and energy regulations, financial regulation, and even more government spending, there is no lack of significant threats for us to understand and address

We&#8217;re Spending Too Much Americans are increasingly concerned with the growth of government, but we also need a positive vision of what smaller government means, a vision that goes beyond lower taxes and economic efficiency Without that positive vision, the appeal of liberty is limited. This presentation provides a vision of how we can regain the moral high ground and make a new case for liberty and smaller government that appeals to all Americans, rich and poor.
