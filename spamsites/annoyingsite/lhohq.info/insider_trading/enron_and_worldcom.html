involving the covert interception of foreign communications hasbeen
practised by almost every advanced nation since international
telecommunicationsbecame available. Comint is a large-scale industrial
activity providingconsumers with intelligence on diplomatic, economic
and scientific developments.The capabilities of and constraints on
Comint activity may usefully beconsidered in the framework of the
"intelligence cycle" (section 1).</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">2.
Globally, about 15-20 billion Eurois expended annually on Comint and
related activities. The largest componentof this expenditure is
incurred by the major English-speaking nations ofthe UKUSA alliance.</font></font><b><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">This
report describes how Comint organisations have for more than 80
yearsmade arrangements to obtain access to much of the world's
internationalcommunications. These include the unauthorised
interception of commercialsatellites, of long distance communications
from space, of undersea cablesusing submarines, and of the Internet. In
excess of 120 satellite systemsare currently in simultaneous operation
collecting intelligence (section2).</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">3.
The highly automated UKUSA systemfor processing Comint, often known as
ECHELON, has been widely discussedwithin Europe following a 1997 STOA
report.</font></font><a href="#N_2_"><b>(</b>2<b>)</b></a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">That report summarised information from the only two primary sources thenavailable on ECHELON.</font></font><b><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">This
report provides original new documentary and other evidence aboutthe
ECHELON system and its involvement in the interception of
communicationsatellites (section 3). A technical annexe give a
supplementary, detaileddescription of Comint processing methods.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">4.
Comint information derived fromthe interception of international
communications has long been routinelyused to obtain sensitive data
concerning individuals, governments, tradeand international
organisations. This report sets out the organisationaland reporting
frameworks within which economically sensitive informationis collected
and disseminated, summarising examples where European
commercialorganisations have been the subject of surveillance (section
4).</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">5. This
report identifies a previouslyunknown international organisation -
"ILETS" - which has, without parliamentaryor public discussion or
awareness, put in place contentious plans to requiremanufacturers and
operators of new communications systems to build in monitoringcapacity
for use by national security or law enforcement organisations(section
5).</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">6. Comint
organisations now perceivethat the technical difficulties of collecting
communications are increasing,and that future production may be
costlier and more limited than at present.The perception of such
difficulties may provide a useful basis for policyoptions aimed at
protective measures concerning economic information andeffective
encryption (section 6).</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">7. <b>Key findings</b> concerning thestate of the art in Comint include :</font></font></p><ul><ul><li><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Comprehensive
systems exist to access,intercept and process every important modern
form of communications, withfew exceptions (section 2, technical
annexe);</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Contrary
to reports in the press, effective"word spotting" search systems
automatically to select telephone callsof intelligence interest are not
yet available, despite 30 years of research.However, speaker
recognition systems - in effect, "voiceprints" - havebeen developed and
are deployed to recognise the speech of targeted individualsmaking
international telephone calls;</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Recent
diplomatic initiatives by the UnitedStates government seeking European
agreement to the "key escrow" systemof cryptography masked intelligence
collection requirements, and formedpart of a long-term program which
has undermined and continues to underminethe communications privacy of
non-US nationals, including European governments,companies and citizens;</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">There
is wide-ranging evidence indicatingthat major governments are routinely
utilising communications intelligenceto provide commercial advantage to
companies and trade.</font></font></li></ul></ul><dir><dir><dir><a name="Report"></a></dir><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="+3">1.

one purpose, access to every othertype of communications carried on the

The United States SigintSystem (USSS) consists of the National Security
Agency (NSA), militarysupport units collectively called the Central
Security Service, and partsof the CIA and other organisations.
Following wartime collaboration, in1947 the UK and the US made a secret
agreement to continue to conduct collaborativeglobal Comint activities.
Three other English-speaking nations, Canada,Australia and New Zealand
joined the UKUSA agreement as "Second Parties".The UKUSA agreement was
not acknowledged publicly until March 1999, whenthe Australian
government confirmed that its Sigint organisation, DefenceSignals
Directorate (DSD) "does co-operate with counterpart signals
intelligenceorganisations overseas under the UKUSA relationship".<a href="#N_6_">(6)</a>The UKUSA agreement shares facilities, tasks and product between participatinggovernments.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">6.
Although UKUSA Comint agency staffsand budgets have shrunk following
the end of the cold war, they have reaffirmedtheir requirements for
access to all the world's communications. AddressingNSA staff on his
departure in 1992, then NSA director Admiral William Studemandescribed
how "the demands for increased global access are growing". The"business
area" of "global access" was, he said, one of "two, hopefullystrong,
legs upon which NSA must stand" in the next century.</font></font><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></p><dir><a name="_Toc448565516"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">OtherComint organisations</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">7.

In the post cold war era, Comint interceptionhas been constrained by
recognisable industrial features, including therequirement to match
budgets and capabilities to customer requirements.The multi-step
process by means of which communications intelligence issought,
collected, processed and passed on is similar for all countries,and is
often described as the "intelligence cycle". The steps of the
intelligencecycle correspond to distinct organisational and technical
features of Comintproduction. Thus, for example, the administration of
NSA's largest fieldstation in the world, at Menwith Hill in England and
responsible for operatingover 250 classified projects, is divided into
three directorates: OP, Operationsand Plans; CP, Collection Processing;
and EP, Exploitation and Production<b>.</b></font></font><p><img src="RIAA/intelligence_cycle.jpg" align="left" height="346" hspace="9" vspace="9" width="500"><br> </p><dir><a name="_Toc448565518"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Planning</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">9.
Planning first involves determiningcustomer requirements. Customers
include the major ministries of the sponsoringgovernment - notably
those concerned with defence, foreign affairs, security,trade and home
affairs. The overall management of Comint involves the identificationof
requirements for data as well as translating requirements into
potentiallyachievable tasks, prioritising, arranging analysis and
reporting, and monitoringthe quality of Comint product.</font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">10.
Once targets have beenselected, specific existing or new collection
capabilities may be tasked,based on the type of information required,
the susceptibility of the targetedactivity to collection, and the
likely effectiveness of collection.</font></font></p><dir><a name="_Toc448565519"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Accessand collection</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">11.
The first essential of Comintis access to the desired communications
medium so that communications maybe intercepted. Historically, where
long-range radio communications wereused, this task was simple. Some
important modern communications systemsare not "Comint friendly" and
may require unusual, expensive or intrusivemethods to gain access. The
physical means of communication is usuallyindependent of the type of
information carried. For example, inter-citymicrowave radio-relay
systems, international satellite links and fibreoptic submarine cables
will all usually carry mixed traffic of television,telephone, fax, data
links, private voice, video and data.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">12.
Collection follows interception,but is a distinct activity in that many
types of signals may be interceptedbut will receive no further
processing save perhaps technical searchesto verify that communications
patterns remain unchanged. For example, asatellite interception station
tasked to study a newly launched communicationssatellite will set up an
antenna to intercept all that the satellite sendsto the ground. Once a
survey has established which parts of the satellite'ssignals carry,
say, television or communications of no interest, thesesignals will not
progress further within the system.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">13.
Collection includes both acquiringinformation by interception and
passing information of interest downstreamfor processing and
production. Because of the high information rates usedin many modern
networks, and the complexity of the signals within them,it is now
common for high speed recorders or "snapshot" memories temporarilyto
hold large quantities of data while processing takes place. Modern
collectionactivities use secure, rapid communications to pass data via
global networksto human analysts who may be a continent away. Selecting
messages for collectionand processing is in most cases automated,
involving large on-line databanksholding information about targets of
interest.</font></font></p><dir><a name="_Toc448565520"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Processing</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">14.
Processing is the conversionof collected information into a form
suitable for analysis or the productionof intelligence, either
automatically or under human supervision. Incomingcommunications are
normally converted into standard formats identifyingtheir technical
characteristics, together with message (or signal) relatedinformation
(such as the telephone numbers of the parties to a
telephoneconversation).</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">15.
At an early stage, if it is notinherent in the selection of the message
or conversation, each interceptedsignal or channel will be described in
standard "case notation". Case notationfirst identifies the countries
whose communications have been intercepted,usually by two letters. A
third letter designates the general class ofcommunications: C for
commercial carrier intercepts, D for diplomatic messages,P for police
channels, etc. A fourth letter designates the type of
communicationssystem (such as S for multi-channel). Numbers then
designate particularlinks or networks. Thus for example, during the
1980s NSA intercepted andprocessed traffic designated as "FRD" (French
diplomatic) from Chicksands,England, while the British Comint agency
GCHQ deciphered "ITD" (Italiandiplomatic) messages at its Cheltenham
headquarters. </font></font><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">16.
Processing may also involve translationor "gisting" (replacing a
verbatim text with the sense or main points ofa communication).
Translation and gisting can to some degree be automated.</font></font></p><dir><a name="_Toc448565521"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Productionand dissemination</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">17.
Comint production involvesanalysis, evaluation, translation and
interpretation of raw data into finishedintelligence. The final step of
the intelligence cycle is dissemination,meaning the passing of reports
to the intelligence consumers. Such reportscan consist of raw (but
decrypted and/or translated) messages, gists, commentary,or extensive
analyses. The quality and relevance of the disseminated reportslead in
turn to the re-specification of intelligence collection
priorities,thereby completing the intelligence cycle.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">18.
The nature of dissemination ishighly significant to questions of how
Comint is exploited to obtain economicadvantage. Comint activities
everywhere are highly classified because,it is argued, knowledge of the
success of interception would be likelyto lead targets to change their
communications methods to defeat futureinterception. Within the UKUSA
system, the dissemination of Comint reportsis limited to individuals
holding high-level security "SCI" clearances.</font></font><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Further,
because only cleared officials can see Comint reports, only theycan set
requirements and thus control tasking. Officials of commercialcompanies
normally neither have clearance nor routine access to Comint,and may
therefore only benefit from commercially relevant Comint informationto
the extent that senior, cleared government officials permit. The waysin
which this takes place is described in Section 5, below.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">19.
Dissemination is further restrictedwithin the UKUSA organisation by
national and international rules generallystipulating that the Sigint
agencies of each nation may not normally collector (if inadvertently
collected) record or disseminate information aboutcitizens of, or
companies registered in, any other UKUSA nation. Citizensand companies
are collectively known as "legal persons". The opposite procedureis
followed if the person concerned has been targeted by their
nationalComint organisation.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">20. For example, Hager has described</font></font><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">how
New Zealand officials were instructed to remove the names of
identifiableUKUSA citizens or companies from their reports, inserting
instead wordssuch as "a Canadian citizen" or "a US company". British
Comint staff havedescribed following similar procedures in respect of
US citizens followingthe introduction of legislation to limit NSA's
domestic intelligence activitiesin 1978.</font></font><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The
Australian government says that "DSD and its counterparts operate
internalprocedures to satisfy themselves that their national interests
and policiesare respected by the others ... the Rules [on Sigint and
Australian persons]prohibit the dissemination of information relating
to Australian personsgained accidentally during the course of routine
collection of foreigncommunications; or the reporting or recording of
the names of Australianpersons mentioned in foreign communications".</font></font><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The
corollary is also true; UKUSA nations place no restrictions on
intelligencegathering affecting either citizens or companies of any
non-UKUSA nation,including member states of the European Union (except
the UK).</font></font><br> </p><dir><dir><a name="_Toc448565522"></a><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="+3">2.Intercepting international communications</font></font></b><a name="_Toc448565523"></a></dir><p><br><b><u><font face="Arial"><font size="+1">International Leased Carrier(ILC) communications</font></font></u></b></p></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">21.

Save for direct landlineconnections between geographically contiguous
nations, high frequency (HF)radio system were the most common means of
international telecommunicationsprior to 1960, and were in use for ILC,
diplomatic and military purposes.An important characteristic of HF
radio signals is that they are reflectedfrom the ionosphere and from
the earth's surface, providing ranges of thousandsof miles. This
enables both reception and interception.</font></font><dir><a name="_Toc448565525"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Microwaveradio relay</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">23.
Microwave radio was introducedin the 1950s to provide high capacity
inter-city communications for telephony,telegraphy and, later,
television. Microwave radio relay communicationsutilise low power
transmitters and parabolic dish antennae placed on towersin high
positions such as on hilltops or tall buildings. The antennae
areusually 1-3m in diameter. Because of the curvature of the earth,
relaystations are generally required every 30-50km.</font></font><dir><a name="_Toc448565526"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Subseacables</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">24.
Submarine telephone cablesprovided the first major reliable high
capacity international communicationssystems. Early systems were
limited to a few hundred simultaneous telephonechannels. The most
modern optical fibre systems carry up to 5 Gbps (Gigabitsper second) of
digital information. This is broadly equivalent to about60,000
simultaneous telephone channels.</font></font><dir><a name="_Toc448565527"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Communicationssatellites</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">25.
Microwave radio signalsare not reflected from the ionosphere and pass
directly into space. Thisproperty has been exploited both to provide
global communications and,conversely, to intercept such communications
in space and on land. Thelargest constellation of communications
satellites (COMSATs) is operatedby the International Telecommunications
Satellite organisation (Intelsat),an international treaty organisation.
To provide permanent communicationsfrom point to point or for
broadcasting purposes, communications satellitesare placed into
so-called "geostationary" orbits such that, to the earth-basedobserver,
they appear to maintain the same position in the sky.</font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">26.
The first geostationaryIntelsat satellites were orbited in 1967.
Satellite technology developedrapidly. The fourth generation of
Intelsat satellites, introduced in 1971,provided capacity for 4,000
simulataneous telephone channels and were capableof handling all forms
of communications simultaneously -telephone, telex,telegraph,
television, data and facsimile. In 1999, Intelsat operated 19satellites
of its 5<sup>th </sup>to 8th generations.

Prior to 1970, most communicationssystems (however carried) utilised
analogue or continuous wave techniques.Since 1990, almost all
communications have been digital, and are providingever higher
capacity. The highest capacity systems in general use for theInternet,
called STM-1 or OC-3, operates at a data rate of 155Mbs. (Millionbits
per second; a rate of 155 Mbps is equivalent to sending 3 millionwords
every second, roughly the text of one thousand books a minute.)

From 1945 onwards in theUnited States the NSA and predecessor agencies
systematically obtainedcable traffic from the offices of the major
cable companies. This activitywas codenamed SHAMROCK. These activities
remained unknown for 30 years,until enquiries were prompted by the
Watergate affair. On 8 August 1975,NSA Director Lt General Lew Allen
admitted to the Pike Committee of theUS House of Representatives that :</font></font><dir><dir><dir><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">"NSA systematicallyintercepts international communications, both voice and cable".</font></font></i></dir></dir></dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">30.

High frequency radio signals are relativelyeasy to intercept, requiring
only a suitable area of land in, ideally,a "quiet" radio environment.
From 1945 until the early 1980s, both NSAand GCHQ operated HF radio
interception systems tasked to collect EuropeanILC communications in
Scotland.</font></font><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">32.
The most advanced type of HF monitoringsystem deployed during this
period for Comint purposes was a large circularantenna array known as
AN/FLR-9. AN/FLR-9 antennae are more than 400 metresin diameter. They
can simultaneously intercept and determine the bearingof signals from
as many directions and on as many frequencies as may bedesired. In
1964, AN/FLR-9 receiving systems were installed at San Vitodei
Normanni, Italy; Chicksands, England, and Karamursel, Turkey.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">33.
In August 1966, NSA transferredILC collection activities from its
Scottish site at Kirknewton, to MenwithHill in England. Ten years
later, this activity was again transferred,to Chicksands. Although the
primary function of the Chicksands site wasto intercept Soviet and
Warsaw Pact air force communications, it was alsotasked to collect ILC
and "NDC" (Non-US Diplomatic Communications). Prominentamong such tasks
was the collection of FRD traffic (i.e., French
diplomaticcommunications). Although most personnel at Chicksands were
members ofthe US Air Force, diplomatic and ILC interception was handled
by civilianNSA employees in a unit called DODJOCC.</font></font><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></p><p><font size="-1"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">34.
During the 1970s, BritishComint units on Cyprus were tasked to collect

Long distance microwaveradio relay links may require dozens of
intermediate stations to receiveand re-transmit communications. Each
subsequent receiving station picksup only a tiny fraction of the
original transmitted signal; the remainderpasses over the horizon and
on into space, where satellites can collectit. These principles were
exploited during the 1960s to provide Comintcollection from space. The
nature of microwave "spillage" means that thebest position for such
satellites is not above the chosen target, but upto 80 degrees of
longitude away.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">36.
The first US Comint satellite,CANYON, was launched In August 1968,
followed soon by a second. The satelliteswere controlled from a ground
station at Bad Aibling, Germany. In orderto provide permanent coverage
of selected targets, CANYON satellites wereplaced close to
geostationary orbits. However, the orbits were not exact,causing the
satellites to change position and obtain more data on groundtargets.</font></font><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Seven CANYON satellites were launched between 1968 and 1977.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">37.
CANYON's target was the SovietUnion. Major Soviet communications links
extended for thousands of miles,much of it over Siberia, where
permafrost restricted the reliable use ofunderground cables.
Geographical circumstances thus favoured NSA by makingSoviet internal
communications links highly accessible. The satellitesperformed better
than expected, so the project was extended.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">38.
The success of CANYON led to thedesign and deployment of a new class of
Comint satellites, CHALET. Theground station chosen for the CHALET
series was Menwith Hill, England.Under NSA project P-285, US companies
were contracted to install and assistin operating the satellite control
system and downlinks (RUNWAY) and groundprocessing system (SILKWORTH).
The first two CHALET satellites were launchedin June 1978 and October
1979. After the name of the first satellite appearedin the US press,
they were renamed VORTEX. In 1982, NSA obtained approvalfor expanded
"new mission requirements" and were given funds and facilitiesto
operate four VORTEX satellites simultaneously. A new 5,000m<sup>2</sup>operations
centre (STEEPLEBUSH) was constructed to house processing equipment.When
the name VORTEX was published in 1987, the satellites were
renamedMERCURY.</font></font><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">39.

capabilities over the periodfrom 1967 to 1985. Initially known as
RHYOLITE and later AQUACADE, thesesatellites were operated from a
remote ground station in central Australia,Pine Gap. Using a large
parabolic antenna which unfolded in space, RHYOLITEintercepted lower
frequency signals in the VHF and UHF bands. Larger, mostrecent
satellites of this type have been named MAGNUM and then ORION.

Although precise details of US space-basedSigint satellites launched
after 1990 remain obscure, it is apparent fromobservation of the
relevant ground centres that collection systems haveexpanded rather
than contracted. The main stations are at Buckley Field,Denver,
Colorado; Pine Gap, Australia; Menwith Hill, England; and Bad
Aibling,Germany. The satellites and their processing facilities are
exceptionallycostly (of the order of $1 billion US each). In 1998, the
US National ReconnaissanceOffice (NRO) announced plans to combine the
three separate classes of Sigintsatellites into an Integrated Overhead
Sigint Architecture (IOSA) in orderto " improve Sigint performance and
avoid costs by consolidating systems,utilising ... new satellite and
data processing technologies". </font></font><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">43.
It follows that, within constraintsimposed by budgetary limitation and
tasking priorities, the United Statescan if it chooses direct space
collection systems to intercept mobile communicationssignals and
microwave city-to-city traffic anywhere on the planet. Thegeographical
and processing difficulties of collecting messages simultaneouslyfrom
all parts of the globe suggest strongly that the tasking of
thesesatellites will be directed towards the highest priority national
and militarytargets. Thus, although European communications passing on
inter-city microwaveroutes can be collected, it is likely that they are
normally ignored. Butit is very highly probable that communications to
or from Europe and whichpass through the microwave communications
networks of Middle Eastern statesare collected and processed.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">44.
No other nation (including theformer Soviet Union) has deployed
satellites comparable to CANYON, RHYOLITE,or their successors. Both
Britain (project ZIRCON) and France (projectZENON) have attempted to do
so, but neither persevered. After 1988 theBritish government purchased

Systematic collection of COMSAT ILCcommunications began in 1971. Two
ground stations were built for this purpose.The first at Morwenstow,
Cornwall, England had two 30-metre antennae. Oneintercepted
communications from the Atlantic Ocean Intelsat; the otherthe Indian
Ocean Intelsat. The second Intelsat interception site was atYakima,
Washington in the northwestern United States. NSA's "Yakima
ResearchStation" intercepted communications passing through the Pacific
Ocean Intelsatsatellite.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">46.
ILC interception capability againstwestern-run communications
satellites remained at this level until thelate 1970s, when a second US
site at Sugar Grove, West Virginia was addedto the network. By 1980,
its three satellite antenna had been reassignedto the US Naval Security
Group and were used for COMSAT interception. Large-scaleexpansion of
the ILC satellite interception system took place between 1985and 1995,
in conjunction with the enlargement of the ECHELON processingsystem
(section 3). New stations were constructed in the United States(Sabana
Seca, Puerto Rico), Canada (Leitrim, Ontario), Australia
(Kojarena,Western Australia) and New Zealand (Waihopai, South Island).

Submarine cables now play a dominantrole in international
telecommunications, since - in contrast to the limitedbandwidth
available for space systems - optical media offer seemingly
unlimitedcapacity. Save where cables terminate in countries where
telecommunicationsoperators provide Comint access (such as the UK and
the US), submarinecables appear intrinsically secure because of the
nature of the ocean environment.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">49.
In October 1971, this securitywas shown not to exist. A US submarine,
Halibut, visited the Sea of Okhotskoff the eastern USSR and recorded
communications passing on a militarycable to the Khamchatka Peninsula.
Halibut was equipped with a deep divingchamber, fully in view on the
submarine's stern. The chamber was describedby the US Navy as a "deep
submergence rescue vehicle". The truth was thatthe "rescue vehicle" was
welded immovably to the submarine. Once submerged,deep-sea divers
exited the submarine and wrapped tapping coils around thecable. Having
proven the principle, USS Halibut returned in 1972 and laida high
capacity recording pod next to the cable. The technique involvedno
physical damage and was unlikely to have been readily detectable.</font></font><a href="#N_29_">(29)</a></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">50.
The Okhotsk cable tapping operationcontinued for ten years, involving
routine trips by three different speciallyequipped submarines to
collect old pods and lay new ones; sometimes, morethan one pod at a
time. New targets were added in 1979. That summer, anewly converted
submarine called USS Parche travelled from San Franciscounder the North
Pole to the Barents Sea, and laid a new cable tap nearMurmansk. Its
crew received a presidential citation for their achievement.The Okhotsk
cable tap ended in 1982, after its location was compromisedby a former
NSA employee who sold information about the tap, codenamedIVY BELLS, to
the Soviet Union. One of the IVY BELLS pods is now on displayin the
Moscow museum of the former KGB. The cable tap in the Barents
Seacontinued in operation, undetected, until tapping stopped in 1992.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">51.
During 1985, cable-tapping operationswere extended into the
Mediterranean, to intercept cables linking Europeto West Africa. </font></font><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">After
the cold war ended, the USS Parche was refitted with an extendedsection
to accommodate larger cable tapping equipment and pods. Cable tapscould
be laid by remote control, using drones. USS Parche continues
inoperation to the present day, but the precise targets of its missions
remainunknown. The Clinton administration evidently places high value
on itsachievements, Every year from 1994 to 1997, the submarine crew
has beenhighly commended.</font></font><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Likely
targets may include the Middle East, Mediterranean, eastern Asia,and
South America. The United States is the only naval power known to
havedeployed deep-sea technology for this purpose.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">52. Miniaturised inductive taps recordershave also been used to intercept underground cables.</font></font><a href="#N_32_">(32)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Optical
fibre cables, however, do not leak radio frequency signals andcannot be
tapped using inductive loops. NSA and other Comint agencies havespent a
great deal of money on research into tapping optical fibres,
reportedlywith little success. But long distance optical fibre cables
are not invulnerable.The key means of access is by tampering with
optoelectronic "repeaters"which boost signal levels over long
distances. It follows that any submarinecable system using submerged
optoelectronic repeaters cannot be consideredsecure from interception
and communications intelligence activity.</font></font><br> </p><center><table border="1" width="802"><tbody><tr><td valign="CENTER" width="47%"><center><img src="RIAA/uss_halibut.jpg" height="270" width="400"></center></td><td valign="CENTER" width="53%"><center><img src="RIAA/ivy_bells_pod.jpg" height="271" width="452"></center></td></tr><tr><td valign="CENTER" width="47%"><center><i><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">USS halibut with disguisedchamber for diving</font></font></i></center></td><td valign="CENTER" width="53%"><center><i><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Cable tapping pod laid by USsubmarine off Khamchatka</font></font></i></center></td></tr></tbody></table></center><dir><a name="_Toc448565537"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Interceptingthe Internet</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">53.
The dramatic growth in the size andsignificance of the Internet and of
related forms of digital communicationshas been argued by some to pose
a challenge for Comint agencies. This doesnot appear correct. During
the 1980s, NSA and its UKUSA partners operateda larger international
communications network than the then Internet butbased on the same
technology.</font></font><a href="#N_33_">(33)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">According
to its British partner "all GCHQ systems are linked togetheron the
largest LAN [Local Area Network] in Europe, which is connected toother
sites around the world via one of the largest WANs [Wide Area
Networks]in the world ... its main networking protocol is Internet
Protocol (IP).</font></font><a href="#N_34_">(34)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">This
global network, developed as project EMBROIDERY, includes PATHWAY,the
NSA's main computer communications network. It provides fast,
secureglobal communications for ECHELON and other systems.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">54.
Since the early 1990s, fast andsophisticated Comint systems have been
developed to collect, filter andanalyse the forms of fast digital
communications used by the Internet.Because most of the world's
Internet capacity lies within the United Statesor connects to the
United States, many communications in "cyberspace" willpass through
intermediate sites within the United States. Communicationsfrom Europe
to and from Asia, Oceania, Africa or South America normallytravel via
the United States.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">55.
Routes taken by Internet "packets"depend on the origin and destination
of the data, the systems through whichthey enter and leaves the
Internet, and a myriad of other factors includingtime of day. Thus,
routers within the western United States are at theirmost idle at the
time when central European traffic is reaching peak usage.It is thus
possible (and reasonable) for messages travelling a short distancein a
busy European network to travel instead, for example, via
Internetexchanges in California. It follows that a large proportion of
internationalcommunications on the Internet will by the nature of the
system pass throughthe United States and thus be readily accessible to
NSA.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">56.Standard
Internet messages are composedof packets called "datagrams" . Datagrams
include numbers representingboth their origin and their destination,
called "IP addresses". The addressesare unique to each computer
connected to the Internet. They are inherentlyeasy to identify as to
country and site of origin and destination. Handling,sorting and
routing millions of such packets each second is fundamentalto the
operation of major Internet centres. The same process
facilitatesextraction of traffic for Comint purposes.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">57.
Internet traffic can be accessedeither from international
communications links entering the United States,or when it reaches
major Internet exchanges. Both methods have advantages.Access to
communications systems is likely to be remain clandestine -
whereasaccess to Internet exchanges might be more detectable but
provides easieraccess to more data and simpler sorting methods.
Although the quantitiesof data involved are immense, NSA is normally
legally restricted to lookingonly at communications that start or
finish in a foreign country. Unlessspecial warrants are issued, all
other data should normally be thrown awayby machine before it can be
examined or recorded.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">58.
Much other Internet traffic (whetherforeign to the US or not) is of
trivial intelligence interest or can behandled in other ways. For
example, messages sent to "Usenet" discussiongroups amounts to about 15
Gigabytes (GB) of data per day; the rough equivalentof 10,000 books.
All this data is broadcast to anyone wanting (or willing)to have it.
Like other Internet users, intelligence agencies have opensource access
to this data and store and analyse it. In the UK, the DefenceEvaluation
and Research Agency maintains a 1 Terabyte database containingthe
previous 90 days of Usenet messages.</font></font><a href="#N_35_">(35)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">A
similar service, called "Deja News", is available to users of the
WorldWide Web (WWW). Messages for Usenet are readily distinguishable.
It ispointless to collect them clandestinely.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">59.
Similar considerations affect theWorld Wide Web, most of which is
openly accessible. Web sites are examinedcontinuously by "search
engines" which generate catalogues of their contents."Alta Vista" and
"Hotbot" are prominent public sites of this kind. NSAsimilarly employs
computer "bots" (robots) to collect data of interest.For example, a New
York web site known as JYA.COM </font></font><a href="http://www.jya.com/crypto.htm">(http://www.jya.com/crypto.htm)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">offers
extensive public information on Sigint, Comint and cryptography.The
site is frequently updated. Records of access to the site show
thatevery morning it is visited by a "bot" from NSA's National Computer
SecurityCentre, which looks for new files and makes copies of any that
it finds.</font></font><a href="#N_36_">(36)</a></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">60.
It follows that foreign Internettraffic of communications intelligence
interest - consisting of e-mail,file transfers, "virtual private
networks" operated over the internet,and some other messages - will
form at best a few per cent of the trafficon most US Internet exchanges
or backbone links. According to a formeremployee, NSA had by 1995
installed "sniffer" software to collect suchtraffic at nine major
Internet exchange points (IXPs).</font></font><a href="#N_37_">(37)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The
first two such sites identified, FIX East and FIX West, are operatedby
US government agencies. They are closely linked to nearby

New network operators have constructedmobile phone systems providing
unbroken global coverage using satellitesin low or medium level earth
orbits. These systems are sometimes calledsatellite personal
communications systems (SPCS). Because each satellitecovers only a
small area and moves fast, large numbers of satellites areneeded to
provide continuous global coverage. The satellites can relaysignals
directly between themselves or to ground stations. The first suchsystem
to be completed, Iridium, uses 66 satellites and started operationsin
1998. Iridium appears to have created particular difficulties for

It now appears that the systemidentified as ECHELON has been in
existence for more than 20 years. Theneed for such a system was
foreseen in the late 1960s, when NSA and GCHQplanned ILC satellite
interception stations at Mowenstow and Yakima. Itwas expected that the
quantity of messages intercepted from the new satelliteswould be too
great for individual examination. According to former NSAstaff, the
first ECHELON computers automated Comint processing at thesesites.</font></font><a href="#N_43_">(43)</a></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">68.
NSA and CIA then discovered thatSigint collection from space was more
effective than had been anticipated,resulting in accumulations of
recordings that outstripped the availablesupply of linguists and
analysts. Documents show that when the SILKWORTHprocessing systems was
installed at Menwith Hill for the new satellites,it was supported by
ECHELON 2 and other databanks (see illustration).</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">69.
By the mid 1980s, communicationsintercepted at these major stations
were heavily sifted, with a wide varietyof specifications available for
non-verbal traffic. Extensive further automationwas planned in the mid
1980s as NSA Project P-415. Implementation of thisproject completed the
automation of the previous Watch List activity. From1987 onwards, staff
from international Comint agencies travelled to theUS to attended
training courses for the new computer systems.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">70.
Project P-415/ECHELON made heavyuse of NSA and GCHQ's global
Internet-like communication network to enableremote intelligence
customers to task computers at each collection site,and receive the
results automatically. The key component of the systemare local
"Dictionary" computers, which store an extensive database onspecified
targets, including names, topics of interest, addresses,
telephonenumbers and other selection criteria. Incoming messages are
compared tothese criteria; if a match is found, the raw intelligence is
forwardedautomatically. Dictionary computers are tasked with many
thousands of differentcollection requirements, described as "numbers"
(four digit codes).</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">71.
Tasking and receiving intelligencefrom the Dictionaries involves
processes familiar to anyone who has usedthe Internet. Dictionary
sorting and selection can be compared to usingsearch engines, which
select web pages containing key words or terms andspecifying
relationships. The forwarding function of the Dictionary computersmay
be compared to e-mail. When requested, the system will provide listsof
communications matching each criterion for review, analysis,
"gisting"or forwarding. An important point about the new system is that
before ECHELON,different countries and different stations knew what was
being interceptedand to whom it was sent. Now, all but a fraction of
the messages selectedby Dictionary computers at remote sites are
forwarded to NSA or other customerswithout being read locally.</font></font><br> </p><center><table border="1" width="670"><tbody><tr><td valign="CENTER" width="40%"><center><img src="RIAA/echelon_mhs.jpg" height="259" width="248"></center></td><td valign="CENTER" width="60%"><center><img src="RIAA/sugar_grove.jpg" height="259" width="385"></center></td></tr><tr><td height="50" valign="CENTER" width="40%"><center><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">List of intelligencedatabanks operating at ECHELON Menwith Hill in 1979 included the secondgeneration of ECHELON</font></font></i></center></td><td height="50" valign="CENTER" width="60%"><center><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Satellite interceptionsite at Sugar Grove, West Virginia, showing six antennae targeted on Europeanand Atlantic</font></font></i><br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Ocean regional communicationssatellites</font></font></i></center></td></tr></tbody></table></center><dir><a name="_Toc448565543"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Westminster,London - Dictionary computer</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">72.

Fax messages and computer data(from modems) are given priority in

analysed. The main method of filtering andanalysing non-verbal traffic,
the Dictionary computers, utilise traditionalinformation retrieval
techniques, including keywords. Fast special purposechips enable vast
quantities of data to be processed in this way. The newesttechnique is
"topic spotting". The processing of telephone calls is mainlylimited to
identifying call-related information, and traffic analysis.Effective
voice "wordspotting" systems do not exist are not in use,
despitereports to the contrary. But "voiceprint" type speaker
identification systemshave been in use since at least 1995. The use of
strong cryptography isslowly impinging on Comint agencies'

covert and overt activities which havesubverted the effectiveness of

In 1990 and 1991, the US governmentbecame concerned that the marketing
of a secure telephone system by AT&amp;Tcould curtail Comint activity.
AT&amp;T was persuaded to withdraw its product.In its place the US
government offered NSA "Clipper" chips for incorporationin secure
phones. The chips would be manufactured by NSA, which would alsorecord
built-in keys and pass this information to other government agenciesfor
storage and, if required, retrieval. This proposal proved
extremelyunpopular, and was abandoned. In its place, the US government
proposedthat non government agencies should be required to keep copies
of everyuser's keys, a system called "key escrow" and, later, "key
recovery". Viewedin retrospect, the actual purpose of these proposals
was to provide NSAwith a single (or very few) point(s) of access to
keys, enabling them tocontinue to access private and commercial
communications.</font></font><a name="_Toc448565549"></a><dir><b><u><font face="Arial"><font size="+1">Misrepresentation of law enforcementinterception requirements</font></font></u></b></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">84.
Between 1993 to 1998, the United Statesconducted sustained diplomatic
activity seeking to persuade EU nationsand the OECD to adopt their "key
recovery" system. Throughout this period,the US government insisted
that the purpose of the initiative was to assistlaw enforcement
agencies. Documents obtained for this study suggest thatthese claims
wilfully misrepresented the true intention of US policy.
Documentsobtained under the US Freedom of Information Act indicate that
policymakingwas led exclusively by NSA officials, sometimes to the
complete exclusionof police or judicial officials. For example, when
the specially appointedUS "Ambassador for Cryptography", David Aaron,
visited Britain on 25 November1996, he was accompanied and briefed by
NSA's most senior representativein Britain, Dr James J Hearn, formerly
Deputy Director of NSA. Mr Aaronhad did not meet or consult FBI
officials attached to his Embassy. Hismeeting with British Cabinet
officials included NSA's representative andstaff from Britain's GCHQ,
but police officers or justice officials fromboth nations were excluded.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">85.
Since 1993, unknown to Europeanparliamentary bodies and their electors,
law enforcement officials frommany EU countries and most of the UKUSA
nations have been meeting annuallyin a separate forum to discuss their
requirements for intercepting communications.These officials met under
the auspices of a hitherto unknown organisation,ILETS (International
Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar). ILETSwas initiated and
founded by the FBI. Table 2 lists ILETS meetings heldbetween 1993 and
1997.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">86. At
their 1993 and 1994 meetings,ILETS participants specified law
enforcement user requirements for communicationsinterception. These
appear in a 1974 ILETS document called "IUR 1.0". Thisdocument was
based on an earlier FBI report on "Law Enforcement Requirementsfor the
Surveillance of Electronic Communications", first issued in July1992
and revised in June 1994. The IUR requirement differed little in
substancefrom the FBI's requirements but was enlarged, containing ten
requirementsrather than nine. IUR did not specify any law enforcement
need for "keyescrow" or "key recovery". Cryptography was mentioned
solely in the contextof network security arrangements.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">87.
Between 1993 and 1997 police representativesfrom ILETS were not
involved in the NSA-led policy making process for "keyrecovery", nor
did ILETS advance any such proposal, even as late as 1997.Despite this,
during the same period the US government repeatedly presentedits policy
as being motivated by the stated needs of law enforcement agencies.At
their 1997 meeting in Dublin, ILETS did not alter the IUR. It was
notuntil 1998 that a revised IUR was prepared containing requirements
in respectof cryptography. It follows from this that the US government
misled EUand OECD states about the true intention of its policy.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">88.
This US deception was, however,clear to the senior Commission official
responsible for information security.In September 1996, David Herson,
head of the EU Senior Officers' Groupon Information Security, stated
his assessment of the US "key recovery"project :</font></font></p><dir><dir><dir><dir><i><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">"'Law
Enforcement' is a protectiveshield for all the other governmental
activities ... We're talking aboutforeign intelligence, that's what all
this is about. There is no question[that] 'law enforcement' is a smoke
screen".</font></font></i><a href="#N_56_">(56)</a></dir></dir></dir></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">89.
It should be noted that technically,legally and organisationally, law
enforcement requirements for communicationsinterception differ
fundamentally from communications intelligence. Lawenforcement agencies
(LEAs) will normally wish to intercept a specificline or group of
lines, and must normally justify their requests to a judicialor
administrative authority before proceeding. In contract, Comint
agenciesconduct broad international communications "trawling"
activities, and operateunder general warrants. Such operations do not
require or even supposethat the parties they intercept are criminals.
Such distinctions are vitalto civil liberty, but risk being eroded it
the boundaries between law enforcementand communications intelligence
interception becomes blurred in future.</font></font><br> <center><table border="2" cellspacing="0" width="742"><tbody><tr><td valign="CENTER" width="8%"><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Year</font></font></b></td><td valign="CENTER" width="17%"><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Venue</font></font></b></td><td valign="CENTER" width="27%"><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Non-EUparticipants</font></font></b></td><td valign="CENTER" width="48%"><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">EU participants</font></font></b></td></tr><tr><td valign="CENTER" width="8%"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">1993</font></font></td><td valign="CENTER" width="17%"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Quantico,Virginia, USA</font></font></td><td valign="CENTER" width="27%"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Australia,Canada, Hong Kong, Norway United States</font></font></td><td valign="CENTER" width="48%"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Denmark,France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom</font></font></td></tr><tr><td valign="CENTER" width="8%"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">1994</font></font></td><td valign="CENTER" width="17%"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Bonn, Germany</font></font></td><td valign="CENTER" width="27%"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Australia,Canada, Hong Kong, Norway, United States</font></font></td><td valign="CENTER" width="48%"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Austria,Belgium,

Since the mid-1990s, communicationsintelligence agencies have faced
substantial difficulties in maintainingglobal access to communications
systems. These difficulties will increaseduring and after 2000. The
major reason is the shift in telecommunicationsto high capacity optical
fibre networks. Physical access to cables is requiredfor interception.
Unless a fibre network lies within or passes througha collaborating
state, effective interception is practical only by tamperingwith
optoelectronic repeaters (when installed). This limitation is likelyto
place many foreign land-based high capacity optical fibre networks
beyondreach. The physical size of equipment needed to process traffic,
togetherwith power, communications and recording systems, makes
clandestine activityimpractical and risky.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">107.
Even where access is readily available(such as to COMSATs), the
proliferation of new systems will limit collectionactivities, partly

because some systems (for example, Iridium) cannot be accessedby
presently available systems.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">108.
In the past 15 years the substantialtechnological lead in computers and
information technology once enjoyedby Comint organisations has all but
disappeared. Their principal computersystems are bought "off the shelf"
and are the equal of or even inferiorto those used by first rank
industrial and academic organisations. Theydiffer only in being
"TEMPEST shielded", preventing them emitting radiosignals which could
be used to analyse Sigint activity.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">109.
Communications intelligence organisationsrecognise that the long war
against civil and commercial cryptography hasbeen lost. A thriving
academic and industrial community is skilled in cryptographyand
cryptology. The Internet and the global marketplace have created afree
flow in information, systems and software. NSA has failed in its
missionto perpetuate access by pretending that that "key escrow" and
like systemswere intended to support law enforcement (as opposed to
Comint) requirements.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">110.
Future trends in Comint are likelyto include limits on investment in
Comint collection from space; greateruse of human agents to plant
collection devices or obtain codes than inthe past; and an intensified
effort to attack foreign computer systems,using the Internet and other
means (in particular, to gain access to protectedfiles or
communications before they are encrypted).</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">111.
Attempts to restrict cryptographyhave nevertheless delayed the
large-scale introduction of effective cryptographicsecurity systems.
The reduced cost of computational power has also enabledComint agencies
to deploy fast and sophisticated processing and sortingtools.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">112.

defeating hostile Comint activity by denyingaccess or, where this is

contrasting interests of states is a complex issue. Larger states
havemade substantial investments in Comint capabilities. One member
state isactive in the UKUSA alliance, whilst others are either "third
parties"to UKUSA or have made bilateral arrangements with NSA. Some of
these arrangementswere a legacy of the cold war; others are enduring.
These issues createinternal and international conflicts of interest.
Technical solutions arenot obvious. It should be possible to define a
shared interest in implementingmeasures to defeat future external
Comint activities directed against Europeanstates, their citizens and
commercial activities.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">4. 
A second area of apparentconflict concerns states' desires to provide
communications interceptionfor legitimate law enforcement purposes. The
technical and legal processesinvolved in providing interception for law
enforcement purpose differ fundamentallyfrom those used in
communications intelligence. Partly because of the lackof parliamentary
and public awareness of Comint activities, this distinctionis often
glossed over, particularly by states that invest heavily in Comint.Any
failure to distinguish between legitimate law enforcement
interceptionrequirements and interception for clandestine intelligence
purposes raisesgrave issues for civil liberties. A clear boundary
between law enforcementand "national security" interception activity is
essential to the protectionof human rights and fundamental freedoms.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">5. 
At the present time, Internetbrowsers and other software used in almost
every personal computer in Europeis deliberately disabled such that
"secure" communications they send can,if collected, be read without
difficulty by NSA. US manufacturers are compelledto make these
arrangements under US export rules. A level playing fieldis important.
Consideration could be given to a countermeasure whereby,if systems
with disabled cryptographic systems are sold outside the UnitedStates,
they should be required to conform to an "open standard" such thatthird
parties and other nations may provide additional applications
whichrestore the level of security to at least enjoyed by domestic US

From 1950 until the early 1980s, highcapacity multi-channel analogue
communications systems were usually engineeredusing separate
communications channels carried at different frequenciesThe combined
signal, which could include 2,000 or more speech channels,was a
"multiplex". The resulting "frequency division multiplex" (FDM)
signalwas then carried on a much higher frequency, such as by a
microwave radiosignal.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">2.
Digital communications have almostuniversally taken over from analogue
methods. The basic system of digitalmulti-channel communications is
time division multiplexing (TDM). In aTDM telephony system, the
individual conversational channels are firstdigitised. Information
concerning each channel is then transmitted sequentiallyrather than
simultaneously, with each link occupying successive time "slots".</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">3.
Standards for digital communicationsevolved separately within Europe
and North America. In the United States,the then dominant public
network carrier (the Bell system, run by AT&amp;T)established digital
data standards. The basic building block, a T-1 link,carries the
equivalent of 24 telephone channels at a rate of 1.544 Mbps.Higher
capacity systems operate at greater data transmission rates Thus,the
highest transmission rate, T-5, carries the equivalent of 8,000
speechchannels at a data rate of 560 Mbps.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">4.
Europe adopted a different frameworkfor digital communications, based
on standards originally agreed by theCEPT. The basic European standard
digital link, E-1, carries 30 telephonechannels at a data rate of 2
Mbps. Most European telecommunications systemsare based on E-1 links or
(as in North America), multiples thereof. Thedistinction is significant
because most Comint processing equipment manufacturedin the United
States is designed to handle intercepted communications workingto the
European forms of digital communications.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">5.
Recent digital systems utilise synchronisedsignals carried by very high
capacity optical fibres. Synchronising signalsenables single channels
to be easily extracted from high capacity links.The new system is known
in the US as the synchronous optical network (SONET),although three
equivalent definitions and labels are in use.</font></font><a href="#N_75_">(75)</a><a name="_Toc448565565"></a></p><dir><dir><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">Communications intelligenceequipment</font></font></u></b></dir></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">6.
Dozens of US defence contractors, manylocated in Silicon Valley
(California) or in the Maryland "Beltway" areanear Washington,
manufacture sophisticated Sigint equipment for NSA. MajorUS
corporations, such as Lockheed Martin, Space Systems/Loral, TRW,
Raytheonand Bendix are also contracted by NSA to operate major Sigint
collectionsites. A full report on their products and services is beyond
the scopeof this study. The state of the art in contemporary
communications intelligencemay usefully be demonstrated, however, by
examining some of the Comintprocessing products of two specialist NSA

Both companies include senior ex-NSAstaff as directors. When not

Sigint by virtue of being "TEMPEST screened". AST statesgenerally that
its "equipment is used for signal reconnaissance of
foreigntelecommunications by the United States government". One leading

Wideband (or broadband) signals arenormally intercepted from satellites
or tapped cables in the form of multiplexmicrowave or high frequency
signals. The first step in processing suchsignals for Comint purposes
is "wideband extraction". An extensive rangeof Sigint equipment is
manufactured for this purpose, enabling newly interceptedsystems to be
surveyed and analysed. These include transponder survey equipmentwhich
identify and classify satellite downlinks, demodulators,
decoders,demultiplexers, microwave radio link analysers, link survey
units, carrieranalysis systems, and many other forms of hardware and
software.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">9. A newly
intercepted communicationssatellite or data link can be analysed using
the AST Model 196 "Transpondercharacterisation system". Once its basic
communications structure has beenanalysed, the Model 195 "Wideband
snapshot analyser", also known as SNAPPER,can record sample data from
even the highest capacity systems, sufficientto analyse communications
in minute detail. By the start of 1999, operatingin conjunction with
the Model 990 "Flexible Data Acquisition Unit", thissystems was able to
record, playback and analyse at data rates up to 2.488Gbps (SONET
OC-48). This is 16 times faster than the largest backbone linksin
general use on the Internet; larger than the telephony capacity of
anycurrent communications satellite; and equivalent to 40,000
simultaneoustelephone calls. It can be fitted with 48 Gbyte of memory
(500-1000 timeslarger than found in an average personal computer),
enabling relativelylengthy recordings of high-speed data links. The 2.5
Gbps capacity of asingle SNAPPER unit exceeds the current daily maximum
data rate found ona typical large Internet exchange.</font></font><a href="#N_77_">(77)</a></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">10.
Both AST and IDEAS offer a widerange of recorders, demultiplexers,
scanners and processors, mostly designedto process European type (CEPT)
E-1, E-3 (etc) signals at data rates ofup to 160 Mbps. Signals may be
recorded to banks of high-speed tape recorders,or into high capacity
"RAID"</font></font><a href="#N_78_">(78)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">hard disk networks. Intercepted optical signals can be examined with theAST Model 257E "SONET analyser".</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">11.
Once communications links havebeen analysed and broken down to their
constituent parts, the next stageof Comint collection involves
multi-channel processors which extract andfilter messages and signals
from the desired channels. There are threebroad categories of interest:
"voice grade channels", normally carryingtelephony; fax communications;
and analogue data modems. A wide selectionof multi-channel Comint
processors are available. Almost all of them separatevoice, fax and
data messages into distinct "streams" for downstream processingand
analysis.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">12.
The AST Model 120 multi-channelprocessor - used by NSA in different
configurations known as STARQUAKE,COBRA and COPPERHEAD - can handle
1,000 simultaneous voice channels andautomatically extract fax, data
and voice traffic. Model 128, larger still,can process 16 European E-3
channels (a data rate of 500 Mbps) and extract480 channels of interest.
The 1999 giant of AST's range, the Model 132"Voice Channel
Demultiplexer", can scan up to 56,700 communications
channels,extracting more than 3,000 voice channels of interest. AST
also providesSigint equipment to intercept low capacity VSAT</font></font><a href="#N_79_">(79)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">satellite
services used by smaller businesses and domestic users. Thesesystems
can be intercepted by the AST Model 285 SCPS processor, which
identifiesand extracts up to 48 channels of interest, distinguished
between voice,fax and data.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">13.
According to US government publications,an early Wideband Extraction
system was installed at NSA's Vint Hill Farmsfield station in 1970,
about the time that systematic COMSAT interceptioncollection began.
That station is now closed. US publications identifythe NSA/CSS
Regional Sigint Operations Centre at San Antonio, Texas, asa site
currently providing a multi-channel Wideband Extraction service.</font></font></p><dir><a name="_Toc448565567"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Filtering,data processing, and facsimile analysis</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">14.
Once communications channels havebeen identified and signals of
interest extracted, they are analysed furtherby sophisticated
workstations using special purpose software. AST's ELVIRASignals
Analysis Workstation is typical of this type of Sigint equipment.This
system, which can be used on a laptop computer in covert
locations,surveys incoming channels and extracts standard Comint data,
includingtechnical specifications (STRUM) and information about call
destinations(SRI, or signal related information). Selected
communications are relayedto distant locations using NSA standard
"Collected Signals Data Format"(CSDF).</font></font><a href="#N_80_">(80)</a><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">15.
High-speed data systems can alsobe passed to AST's TRAILMAPPER software
system, which works at a data rateof up to 2.5 Gbps. It can interpret
and analyse every type of telecommunicationssystem, including European,
American and optical standards. TRAILMAPPERappears to have been
designed with a view to analysing ATM (asynchronoustransfer mode)
communications. ATM is a modern, high-capacity digital
communicationssystem. It is better suited than standard Internet
connections to carryingmultimedia traffic and to providing business
with private networks (VPN,LAN or WAN). TRAILMAPPER will identify and
characterise such business networks.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">16.
In the next stage downstream, interceptedsignals are processed
according to whether they are voice, fax or data.AST's "Data
Workstation" is designed to categorise all aspects of
datacommunications, including systems for handling e-mail or sending
fileson the Internet.</font></font><a href="#N_81_">(81)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Although
the very latest modem systems (other than ISDN) are not includedin its

Fax messages are processed by AST'sFax Image Workstation. This is
described as a "user friendly, interactiveanalysis tool for rapid

of these systemsmakes fax-derived Comint an important collection
subsystem. It has onedrawback. OCR computer systems that can reliably
recognise handwritingdo not exist. No one knows how to design such a
system. It follows that,perversely, hand-written fax messages may be a
secure form of communicationthat can evade Dictionary surveillance
criteria, provided always that theassociated "signal related
information" (calling and receiving fax numbers)have not been
recognised as being of interest and directed to a Fax ImageWorkstation.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">18.
AST also make a "Pager Identificationand Message Extraction" system
which automatically collects and processesdata from commercial paging
systems. IDEAS offer a Video TeleconferencingProcessor that can
simultaneously view or record two simultaneous
teleconferencingsessions. Sigint systems to intercept cellular mobile
phone networks suchas GSM are not advertised by AST or IDEAS, but are
available from otherUS contractors. The specifications and ready
availability of such systemsindicate how industrialised and pervasive
Comint has became. It has movedfar from the era when (albeit
erroneously), it was publicly associatedonly with monitoring diplomatic
or military messages.</font></font></p><center><p><img src="RIAA/trail_orig.jpg" height="650" width="668"></p><p><i><font face="Arial"><font size="-1"> NSA "Trailmapper softwareshowing atomatic detection of private networks inside</font></font></i><br><i><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">intercepted high capacity STM-1digital communications system</font></font></i></p></center><dir> <br><a name="_Toc448565568"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Trafficanalysis, keyword recognition, text retrieval, and topic analysis</font></font></b></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">19.
Traffic analysis is a method of obtainingintelligence from signal
related information, such as the number dialledon a telephone call, or
the Calling Line Identification Data (CLID) whichidentifies the person
making the call. Traffic analysis can be used wheremessage content is
not available, for example when encryption is used.By analysing calling
patterns, networks of personal associations may beanalysed and studied.
This is a principal method of examining voice communications.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">20.
Whenever machine readable communicationsare available, keyword
recognition is fundamental to Dictionary computers,and to the ECHELON
system. The Dictionary function is straightforward.Its basic mode of
operation is akin to web search engines. The differencesare of
substance and of scale. Dictionaries implement the tasking of theirhost
station against the entire mass of collected communications, and
automatethe distribution of selected raw product.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">21.
Advanced systems have been developedto perform very high speed sorting
of large volumes of intercepted information.In the late 1980s, the
manufacturers of the RHYOLITE Sigint satellites,TRW, designed and
manufactured a Fast Data Finder (FDF) microchip for NSA.The FDF chip
was declassified in 1972 and made available for commercialuse by a
spin-off company, Paracel. Since then Paracel has sold over
150information filtering systems, many of them to the US government.
Paraceldescribes its current FDF technology as the "fastest, most
accurate adaptivefiltering system in the world":</font></font></p><dir><dir><dir><dir><i><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">A

A lower capacity system, the PRP-9800Pattern Recognition Processor, is
manufactured by IDEAS. This is a computercard which can be fitted to a

E-3 standard), matching every single bitto more than 1000 pre-selected

Powerful though Dictionary methodsand keyword search engines may be,
however, they and their giant associatedintelligence databases may soon
seem archaic. Topic analysis is a morepowerful and intuitive technique,
and one that NSA is developing and promotingwith confidence. Topic
analysis enables Comint customers to ask their computersto "find me
documents about subject X". X might be "Shakespeare in love"or "Arms to
Iran".</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">24. In a standard US test used to evaluatetopic analysis systems,</font></font><a href="#N_83_">(83)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">one
task the analysis program is given is to find information about
"Airbussubsidies". The traditional approach involves supplying the
computer withthe key terms, other relevant data, and synonyms. In this
example, thedesignations A-300 or A-320 might be synonymous with
"Airbus". The disadvantageof this approach is that it may find
irrelevant intelligence (for example,reports about export subsidies to
goods flown on an Airbus) and miss relevantmaterial (for example a
financial analysis of a company in the consortiumwhich does not mention
the Airbus product by name). Topic analysis overcomesthis and is better
matched to human intelligence.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">25.
The main detectable thrust of NSAresearch on topic analysis centres on
a method called N-gram analysis.Developed inside NSA's Research group -
responsible for Sigint automation- N-gram analysis is a fast, general
method of sorting and retrieving machine-readabletext according to
language and/or topic. The N-gram system is claimed towork
independently of the language used or the topic studied. NSA
patentedthe method in 1995.</font></font><a href="#N_84_">(84)</a></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">26.
To use N-gram analysis, the operatorignores keywords and defines the
enquiry by providing the system with selectedwritten documents
concerning the topic of interest. The system determineswhat the topic
is from the seed group of documents, and then calculatesthe probability
that other documents cover the same topic. In 1994, NSAmade its N-gram
system available for commercial exploitation. NSA's researchgroup
claimed that it could be used on "very large data sets (millionsof
documents)", could be quickly implemented on any computer system
andthat it could operate effectively "in text containing a great many
errors(typically 10-15% of all characters)".</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">27.

For more than 40 years, NSA, ARPA,GCHQ and the British government Joint
Speech Research Unit have conductedand sponsored research into speech
recognition. Many press reports (andthe previous STOA report) have
suggested that such research has providedsystems which can
automatically select telephone communications of intelligenceinterest
based on the use of particular "key words" by a speaker. If
available,such systems would enable vastly more extensive Comint
information to begathered from telephone conversations than is
available from other methodsof analysis. The contention that telephone
word-spotting systems are readilyavailable appears to by supported by
the recent availability of a stringof low-cost software products
resulting from this research. These productspermit PC users to dictate
to their computers instead of entering datathrough the keyboard. </font></font><a href="#N_86_">(86)</a><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">29.
The problem is that for Comintapplications, unlike personal computer
dictation products, speech recognitionsystems have to operate in a
multi-speaker, multi-language environmentwhere numerous previously
never heard speakers may each feature physiologicaldifferences, dialect
variations, and speech traits. Commercial PC systemsusually require one
or more hours of training in order reliably to recognisea single
speaker. Even then, such systems may mistranscribe 10% or moreof the
words spoken.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">30.
In PC dictation applications, thespeaker can correct mistranscriptions
and continually retrain the recognitionsystem, making a moderate error
rate acceptable. For use in Comint, wherethe interception system has no
prior knowledge of what has been said (oreven the language in use), and
has to operate in the poorer signal environmentof a telephone speech
channel, such error rates are unachievable. Worsestill, even moderate
error rates can make a keyword recognition systemworthless by
generating both false positive outputs (words wrongly identifiedas
keywords) and false negative outputs (missing genuine keywords).</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">31.
This study has found no evidencethat voice keyword recognition systems
are currently operationally deployed,nor that they are yet sufficiently
accurate to be worth using for intelligencepurposes.</font></font></p><dir><dir><a name="_Toc448565570"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Continuousspeech recognition</font></font></b></dir></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">32.
The fundamental technique in manyspeech recognition applications is a
statistical method called Hidden MarkovModelling (HMM). HMM systems
have been developed at many centres and areclaimed academically to
offer "good word spotting performance ... usingvery little or no
acoustic speech training".</font></font><a href="#N_87_">(87)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The
team which reported this result tested its system using data from theUS
Department of Defense "Switchboard Data", containing recordings of
thousandof different US telephone conversations. On a limited test the
probabilitiesof correctly detecting the occurrences of 22 keywords
ranged from 45-68%on settings which allowed for 10 false positive
results per keyword perhour. Thus if 1000 genuine keywords appeared
during an hour's conversation,there would be at least 300 missed key
words, plus 220 false alarms.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">33.
At about the same time, (February1990), the Canadian Sigint
organisation CSE awarded a Montreal-based computerresearch consultancy
the first of a series of contracts to develop a Comintwordspotting
system.</font></font><a href="#N_88_">(88)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The
goal of the project was to build a word-spotter that worked well
evenfor noisy calls. Three years later, CRIM reported that "our
experiencehas taught us that, regardless of the environmental
conditions, wordspottingremains a difficult problem". The key problem,
which is familiar to humanlisteners, is that a single word heard on its
own can easily be misinterpreted,whereas in continuous speech the
meaning may be deduced from surroundingwords. CRIM concluded in 1993
that "it is probable that the most effectiveway of building a reliable
wordspotter is to build a large vocabulary continuousspeech recognition
(CSR) system".</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">34.
Continuous speech recognition softwareworking in real time needs a
powerful fast, processor. Because of the lackof training and the
complex signal environment found in intercepted telephonecalls, it is
likely that even faster processors and better software thanused in
modern PCs would yield poorer results than are now provided
bywell-trained commercial systems. Significantly, an underlying problem
isthat voice keyword recognition is, as with machine-readable messages,
animperfect means to the more useful intelligence goal - topic spotting.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">35.

recent meeting of American defense contractors... indicate that this
may in fact be an excellent approach to the problem".They offered to
produce an "operational topic spotting" system by 1995.They did not
succeed. Four years later, they were still experimenting onhow to built
a voice topic spotter.</font></font><a href="#N_89_">(89)</a><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">They received a further research contract.

In 1993, CRIM also undertook to supplyCSE with an operational speaker
identification module by March 1995. Nothingmore was said about this
project, suggesting that the target may have beenmet. In the same year,
according to NSA documents, the IDEAS company supplieda "Voice Activity
Detector and Analyser", Model TE464375-1, to NSA's officesinside GCHQ
Cheltenham. The unit formed the centre of a 14-position computerdriven
voice monitoring system. This too may have been an early
speakeridentification system.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">37.
In 1995, widely quoted reportssuggested that NSA speaker identification
had been used to help capturethe drug cartel leader Pablo Escobar. The
reports bore strong resemblanceto a novel by Tom Clancy, suggesting
that the story may have owed moreto Hollywood than high tech. In 1997,
the Canadian CRE awarded a contractto another researcher to develop
"new retrieval algorithms for speech characteristicsused for speaker
identification", suggesting this method was not by thena fully mature
technology. According to Sigint staff familiar with thecurrent use of
Dictionary, it can be programmed to search to identify
particularspeakers on telephone channels. But speaker identification is
still nota particularly reliablr or effective Comint technique.</font></font><a href="#N_90_">(90)</a></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">38.
In the absence of effective wordspottingor speaker identification
techniques, NSA has sought alternative meansof automatically analysing
telephone communications. According NSA's classificationguide, other
techniques examined include Speech detection - detecting thepresence or
absence of speech activity; Speaker discrimination - techniquesto
distinguish between the speech of two or more speakers; and
Readabilityestimation - techniques to determine the quality of speech
signals. Systemdescriptions must be classified "secret" if NSA
"determines that they representmajor advances over techniques known in
the research community".</font></font><a href="#N_91_">(91)</a><a name="_Toc448565572"></a></p><dir> <br><b><u><font face="Arial"><font size="+1">"Workfactor reduction"; thesubversion of cryptographic systems</font></font></u></b></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">39.
From the 1940s to date, NSA has underminedthe effectiveness of
cryptographic systems made or used in Europe. Themost important target
of NSA activity was a prominent Swiss manufacturingcompany, Crypto AG.
Crypto AG established a strong position as a supplierof code and cypher
systems after the second world war. Many governmentswould not trust
products offered for sale by major powers. In contrast,Swiss companies
in this sector benefited from Switzerland's neutralityand image of
integrity.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">40. NSA
arranged to rig encryptionsystems sold by Crypto AG, enabling UKUSA
agencies to read the coded diplomaticand military traffic of more than
130 countries. NSA's covert interventionwas arranged through the
company's owner and founder Boris Hagelin, andinvolved periodic visits
to Switzerland by US "consultants" working forNSA. One was Nora L
MacKabee, a career NSA employee. A US newspaper obtainedcopies of
confidential Crypto AG documents recording Ms Mackebee's attendanceat
discussion meetings in 1975 to design a new Crypto AG machine".</font></font><a href="#N_92_">(92)</a></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">41.
The purpose of NSA's interventionswere to ensure that while its coding
systems should appear secure to othercryptologists, it was not secure.
Each time a machine was used, its userswould select a long numerical
key, changed periodically. Naturally userswished to selected their own
keys, unknown to NSA. If Crypto AG's machineswere to appear strong to
outside testers, then its coding system shouldwork, and actually be
strong. NSA's solution to this apparent condundrumwas to design the
machine so that it broadcast the key it was using tolisteners. To
prevent other listeners recognising what was happening, thekey too had
also to be sent in code - a different code, known only to NSA.Thus,
every time NSA or GCHQ intercepted a message sent using these
machines,they would first read their own coded part of the message,
called the "hilfsinformationen"(help information field) and extract the
key the target was using. Theycould then read the message itself as
fast or even faster than the intendedrecipient</font></font><a href="#N_93_">(93)</a></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">42.
The same technique was re-usedin 1995, when NSA became concerned about
cryptographic security systemsbeing built into Internet and E-mail
software by Microsoft, Netscape andLotus. The companies agreed to adapt
their software to reduce the levelof security provided to users outside
the United States. In the case ofLotus Notes, which includes a secure
e-mail system, the built-in cryptographicsystem uses a 64 bit
encryption key. This provides a medium level of security,which might at
present only be broken by NSA in months or years.</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">43.
Lotus built in an NSA "help information"trapdoor to its Notes system,
as the Swedish government discovered to itsembarrassment in 1997. By
then, the system was in daily use for confidentialmail by Swedish MPs,
15,000 tax agency staff and 400,000 to 500,000 citizens.Lotus Notes
incorporates a "workfactor reduction field" (WRF) into alle-mails sent
by non US users of the system. Like its predecessor the CryptoAG "help
information field" this device reduces NSA's difficulty in
readingEuropean and other e-mail from an almost intractable problem to
a few secondswork. The WRF broadcasts 24 of the 64 bits of the key used
for each communication.The WRF is encoded, using a "public key" system
which can only be readby NSA. Lotus, a subsidiary of IBM, admits this.
The company told SvenskaDagbladet:</font></font></p><dir><dir><dir><dir><i><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">"The
difference between the AmericanNotes version and the export version
lies in degrees of encryption. Wedeliver 64 bit keys to all customers,
but 24 bits of those in the versionthat we deliver outside of the
United States are deposited with the Americangovernment".</font></font><a href="#N_94_">(94)</a></i></dir></dir></dir></dir><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">44.
Similar arrangements are built intoall export versions of the web
"browsers" manufactured by Microsoft andNetscape. Each uses a standard
128 bit key. In the export version, thiskey is not reduced in length.
Instead, 88 bits of the key are broadcastwith each message; 40 bits
remain secret. It follows that almost everycomputer in Europe has, as a
built-in standard feature, an NSA workfactorreduction system to enable
NSA (alone) to break the user's code and readsecure messages.</font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">45.
The use of powerful and effectiveencryption systems will increasingly
restrict the ability of Comint agenciesto process collected
intelligence. "Moore's law" asserts that the costof computational power
halves every 18 months. This affects both the agenciesand their
targets. Cheap PCs can now efficiently perform complex
mathematicalcalculations need for effective cryptography. In the
absence of new discoveriesin physics or mathematics Moore's law favours
codemakers, not codebreakers.</font></font><br> <br> </p><dir><dir><dir><center><img src="RIAA/line1.gif" height="6" width="548"><p><i><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Illustrations : D Campbell; US AirForce; IPTV Ltd; Stephen King; Charles V Pick; IPTV Ltd;</font></font></i><br><i><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Jim Bamford, GCHQ; US Navy; KGB/RussianSecurity Service; D Campbell.</font></font></i></p><p><img src="RIAA/line1.gif" height="6" width="548"></p></center><dir><dir><a name="Glossary"></a><p><b><i><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="+3">Glossary and definitions</font></font></i></b><br> </p></dir></dir></dir></dir></dir><table border="0" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="2" width="955"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="12%"><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">ATM</font></font></b></td><td valign="top" width="88%"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">AsynchronousTransfer Mode; a high speed form of digital communications increasinglyused for on the Internet</font></font></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="12%"><b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">BND</font></font></b></td><td valign="top" width="88%"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Bundesachrichtendienst;the foreign intelligence agency of the Federal Republic of Germany.

appears to be an attempt to comply with legal restrictionsin the
Interception of Communications Act 1985, which prohibit GCHQ
fromhandling messages except those identified in government
"certificates"which "describe the intercepted material which should be
examined". TheAct specifies that "so much of the intercepted material
as is not certifiedby the certificate is not [to be] read, looked at or
listened to by anyperson". It appears from this that, although all
messages passing throughthe United Kingdom are intercepted and sent to
GCHQ's London office, theorganisation considers that by having British

control of the telecommunicationsnetwork operator unless and until it
