The people were asked to curb their prejudice against corporations. It

was promised that in the future corporations should be honestly run, and

in the interest of the stockholders and the public. Dru expressed the

hope that their formation would be welcomed rather than discouraged, for

he was sure that under the new law it would be more to the public

advantage to have business conducted by corporations than by individuals

in a private capacity. In the taxation of real estate, the unfair

practice of taxing it at full value when mortgaged and then taxing the

holder of the mortgage, was to be abolished. The same was to be true of

bonded indebtedness on any kind of property. The easy way to do this was

to tax property and not tax the evidence of debt, but Dru preferred the

other method, that of taxing the property, less the debt, and then

taxing the debt wherever found.

His reason for this was that, if bonds or other forms of debt paid no

taxes, it would have a tendency to make investors put money into that

kind of security, even though the interest was correspondingly low, in

order to avoid the trouble of rendering and paying taxes on them. This,

he thought, might keep capital out of other needful enterprises, and

give a glut of money in one direction and a paucity in another. Money

itself was not to be taxed as was then done in so many States.

<h2 style="position:absolute; left: 10em;">THE RAILROAD PROBLEM</h2>

While the boards and commissions appointed by Administrator Dru were

working out new tax, tariff and revenue laws, establishing the judiciary

and legal machinery on a new basis and revising the general law, it was

necessary that the financial system of the country also should be

reformed. Dru and his advisers saw the difficulties of attacking this

most intricate question, but with the advice and assistance of a

commission appointed for that purpose, they began the formulation of a

new banking law, affording a flexible currency, bottomed largely upon

commercial assets, the real wealth of the nation, instead of upon debt,

as formerly.



This measure was based upon the English, French and German plans, its

authors taking the best from each and making the whole conform to

American needs and conditions. Dru regarded this as one of his most

pressing reforms, for he hoped that it would not only prevent panics, as

formerly, but that its final construction would completely destroy the

credit trust, the greatest, the most far reaching and, under evil

direction, the most pernicious trust of all.



While in this connection, as well as all others, he was insistent that

business should be honestly conducted, yet it was his purpose to throw

all possible safeguards around it. In the past it had been not only

harassed by a monetary system that was a mere patchwork affair and

entirely inadequate to the needs of the times, but it had been

constantly threatened by tariff, railroad and other legislation

calculated to cause continued disturbance. The ever-present demagogue

had added to the confusion, and, altogether, legitimate business had

suffered more during the long season of unrest than had the law-defying

monopolies.


Dru wanted to see the nation prosper, as he knew it could never have

done under the old order, where the few reaped a disproportionate reward

and to this end he spared no pains in perfecting the new financial

system. In the past the railroads and a few industrial monopolies had

come in for the greatest amount of abuse and prejudice. This feeling

while largely just, in his opinion, had done much harm. The railroads

were the offenders in the first instance, he knew, and then the people

retaliated, and in the end both the capitalists who actually furnished

the money to build the roads and the people suffered.

This request is designed to implement the analytical and IT requirements for the NSAC by augmenting the existing HSPD-2 operations to provide the additional analysis and technology support for the NSB.
Justification The NSAC will include FTTTF Operations under HSPD-2 and expand to support NSB requirements, as seen in the diagram below. This diagram is a visual representation of the NSAC, including lines of authority, business areas, existing and expanded operations, information technology (IT) and prioritized IT projects and programs. The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) will provide IT support to the NSAC, as they now do for the FTTTF.
