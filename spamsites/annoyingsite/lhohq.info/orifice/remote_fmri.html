But it will also  have caused alarm among other people in the public eye  who deal with sensitive information - or anyone, indeed, who  values their privacy. If the secretary general of the United Nations cannot  prevent his private conversations from being listened to by  all and sundry, who can? It seems if someone wants to listen to what you are saying  badly enough, there is very little you can do to stop it. "Technological advances, particularly in the fields of power  supply and miniaturisation, mean that its now possible to  bug almost anywhere and anything," says Charles  Shoebridge, a former counter-terrorism intelligence officer. "Similar advances have enormously improved anti-bugging capabilities too, and an enormous effort has gone into  making communications secure - particularly those of  governments and even large commercial organisations. "However, if security is absolutely critical, it will always pay to  assume that a conversation is at l

How did the Pledge of Allegiance turn libertarian people into flagety libertines? How did the government bamboozle individuals into believing that robotic group-chanting in government schools is a beautiful expression of freedom? America's flag obscenities started as early as 1875, and continued through the creation of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (German Nazis or NSGWP).  In 1875, the Theosophical Society was created in New York. The TS was orgainized by Madame H.P. Blavatsky, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott (U.S. army, retired, and a writer for the New York Daily Graphic), and Charles Sotheran (an author, socialist, and a Freemason Supreme Council member of the Scottish Rite, a "secret society" steeped in ritual and alleged occult interests). The TS grew rapidly and soon after became international. http://rexcurry.net/theosophy-madame-blavatsky-theosophical-society.html The Theosophical Society (TS) touted the explicit collectivist goal of "universal brotherhood." The political product was socialism and self-sacrifice to government by calling it the "greater good."  The TS dogma reveals no knowledge of economics, markets, prices, trade or private property rights. Theosophy is similar to other civic, religious or philosophical groups where followers are easily seduced and raped by socialists.</b> </div> <br> </blockquote> </div> <div style="font-size:200%"> </b> </div> <div style=float:left> <b> <P> </div> <br> </blockquote> </div> <br> </div> <div style=float:left> <b> thanks.  7 Special transmission today @ High Noon.

Whether it was done toward the USA's flag or toward the swastika flag, the kinky chanting and the gesticulation represented submission and obedience to follow authority and obey commands  The NSGWP had clear roots in National Socialism promoted by socialists in the USA. The ritualized humiliation and degradation has inspired bondage and discipline and sadism masochism (BDSM and sado-masochism) and even death.
