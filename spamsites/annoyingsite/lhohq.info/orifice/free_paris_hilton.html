The history of the spy satellites:


December 1953:  U.S. Air Force, which had been split off from 
		the Army in 1947, pulls to gether all its 
		various satellite efforts into a single program 
		known as WS-117L. 

October 1956:   Lockheed Air craft Corp. gets the first WS 117L 
		production contract. 

Feb. 28, 1958:  The Defense Department officially cancels the 
		reconnaissance-satellite segment of WS-117L in
 		an effort to plug security leaks. The project, 
		now carrying the name "Corona," undergoes what 
		the Central Intelligence Agency calls "covert 
		reactivation only a small number of govern ment
		officials, Lockheed em ployees and employees at
		other defense contracting companies are briefed
		on the new effort. 

Jan. 21, 1959: The first attempt to launch a rocket designed to
		carry the Corona satellite, as sembled at the 
		Hiller Aircraft plant in Menlo Park, ends in 
		failure 60 minutes before blast off at Vandenberg 
		Air Force Base near Santa Barbara when explosive 
		bolts are triggered accidentally, damaging the 
		rocket. 

Feb. 28,1959:   Discoverer 1, the cover name for Corona rock ets, 
		lifts off from Vandenberg and disappears. No one 
		knows what happened, but it is be lieved to have 
		crashed some where near the South Pole. 

April 13, 1959: Discoverer ll goes into orbit and successfully 
		ejects a test capsule. But, because of a timing 
		error, the capsule lands somewhere on the island 
		of Spitsbergen, north of Norway, instead of hitting
		its target near Hawaii. The cap sule is never 
		found; CIA officials suspect it may have been 
		snatched by the Soviets. 

June 3, 1959: 	Discoverer lll, carrying four mice, crashes in the 
		Pacific Ocean shortly after takeoff. 

June 25, 1959: 	Discoverer IV carries the first Corona camera, caned.
		KH-1, an abbreviation of the code name Keyhole. The 
		rocket fails to reach orbit. Three more launches in 
		August and November also are busts. 

Aug 10, 1959: 	Discoverer Xlll is a partlal success the satellite 
		successfully reaches orbit and ejects a capsule, 
		carrying an American Hag and test equip ment. The 
		capsule lands north of Hawaii the next day, 600 miles
		off target, and is recov ered after floating in the 
		ocean.

Aug 19, 1959: 	With almost no public fanfare, Discoverer XIV is the
		first truly successful Corona mission. The retuming 
		capsule, containing 20 pounds of film and suspended 
		from a para chute, is snatched from midair by an Air 
		Force C-119 aircraft. <a href="../video_cassette_recorder/VCR.html">The images, although fuzzier 
		than U-2 photographs</a>, cover areas of the Soviet Union
		never reached by the spy planes. 

Dec 10, 1959:	Discoverer XVIII is the second truly successful 
		mission, returning 39 pounds of film filled with 
		images from an improved camera, the KH-2. 

Aug. 30, 1961:  Corona up grades to the-KH-3 camera, doubling the Ibvel
		of detail. 

Feb. 27, 1962:  The last launch in the Discoverer series, Dis coverer 
		XXXVIII, is a success ful debut mission for the new KH 
		4 camera. The Air Force now imposes a total security 
		blanket on Corona, <a href="current_information.html">future launches will be secret, with
		 no effort to maintain a cover story of scientific research.</a> 

1966: 		Corona reaches its prime. From May 1966 through February 
		1971, 32 launches in a row are either partially or 
		completely successful. 

June 15, 1971:  A new-genera tion spy satellite called "Hexa gon" is 
		launched from Vanden berg. It carries a KH-9 camera, 
		capable of exposing more film and covering a wider area
		on the ground. 

May 25, 1972:   The final Corona mission is launched, with the final 
		capsule recovered on May 31. During the life of the program,
		Corona mapped 750 million sguare miles of the Earth's 
		surface, mostly ih the Soviet Union and China; the resolution
		of its cameras improved from initially distinguishing objects
		on the ground no smaller than 20 feet to picking out objects 
		just five feet across. 

Feb. 22, 1995:  President Clinton signs an executive officer declassifying 
		Corona, the first time the United States has re leased a 
		significant amount of information about its spy satellite 
		programs.
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		Dear Friends:

                      I thank you for your assistance
                 these many years. It seems, however,
                 that my greatest utility has come to an
                 end, and it is time to seclude myself
                 from active service.

                      Since communicating last, and one
                 wonders if because of it, I have been
                 promoted to a higher do-nothing Senior
                 Executive job outside of regular access
                 to informaiton [sic] within the
                 counterintelligence program. It is as if
                 I am being isolated. Furthermore, I
                 believe I have detected repeated
                 bursting radio signal emanations from my
                 vehicle. I have not found their source,
                 but as you wisely do, I will leave this
                 alone, for knowledge of their existence
                 is sufficient. Amusing the games
                 children play. In this, however, I
                 strongly suspect you should have
                 concerns for the integrity of your
                 compartment concerning knowledge of my
                 efforts on your behalf. Something has
                 aroused the sleeping tiger. Perhaps you
                 know better than I.

                      Life is full of ups and downs.

                      My hope is that, if you respond to
                 this constant-conditions-of-connection
                 message, you will have provided some
                 sufficient means of re-contact besides
                 it. If not, I will be in contact next
                 year, same time same place. Perhaps the
                 correlation of forces and circumstances
                 then will have improved.

                 Your friend,



On another subject - as far as Groom Lake goes -- here's something to ponder: We know that Groom was used for the U-2 in the 1950s, the SR-71 in the early 1960s, and various Stealth stuff in the late 1970s and early 1980s. What was Groom used for in the late 1960s and early 1970s? In some research I've been doing with Department of Energy material, I'm picking up hints that Groom Lake was used for unknown classified experiments conducted by Los Alamos National Laboratory, during that period. This is interesting, because LANL doesn't do much with nuclear weapons design (which is usually handled by Sandia National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National
