blurs this distinction\ and creates a semantic atmosphere in which they \seem\ to be discussing "law" in the scientific sense. I do not want to be uncharitable and accuse such writers of dishonesty, but it certainly appears that their language habits create confusion, and I suspect that the Natural Law theorists confuse themselves even more that they confuse their readers. The worst source of this semantic chaos appears to me to be the phrase, "Natural Law," itself, since it is rather grossly obvious that nothing can ever happen that truly violates nature, at least as the word "nature" is used in science and, I daresay, 99 percent of the time in ordinary speech. As I mentioned earlier, while I was involved in the "Natural Law" debate in America via \New Libertarian\, I was involved in two similar debates in Ireland. In the first debate, the Catholic Church, through every pulpit in the land, was denouncing the government's attempt to legalize divorce as "against Nature" and in the second debate, less nationally publicized, some witches and Druids and neo-pagans were debating with one another, in a magazine called \Ancient Ways\, about whether machinery and antiaging research "were" or "were not" against "nature." I created considerable confusion, hostility and incredulity, in both the Catholic and pagan camps, by simply insisting that nothing that 40 happens in nature can be meaningfully said to be "against" nature. It seems to be very hard for Natural Law cultists of all stripes to understand this. For instance, one shadowy philosopher writing under the name "Peter Z." -and I don't blame him for his near-anonymity; itcan be dangerous to be associated publicly with paganism in Holy Catholic Ireland -replied to each of my attempts to explain  ###<h1 style='float:left'>Homosexual</h1> on until until Support Activist Judges Stop buying these products </p> Stupid <a

Published on Purim, 14 Adar 5768 (09-10 March 2009).
...Esther reads more like an adventure romance  novelette than a book of scripture.  Its sole purpose  was to establish Purim, a holiday when the ancient Jews  ruthlessly struck back against their former oppressors.   In Hebrew, Purim means lots, named after the lottery  Haman used to choose the day for the massacre.   The Persian word is Pur.  On this day, the Talmud gives  permission, even encouragement, to getting drunk,  cursing, reviling and spitting on Christians...Read More
ROME GAVE BIRTH TO JUDAISM 
By Harrell Rhome, M.Div., Ph.D.
....In the first century, for all intents and purposes,  the Roman Empire gave birth to two major  world religions: Judaism and Christianity.   The modern Judaic religion was created directly  through their actions, both hostile and conciliatory.   Before beginning this saga, we must understand  the zeitgeist, the spirit of the age,  in the ancient world...Read More
PRECURSORS  TO THE PROTOCOLS 
OF ZION By Dr. Harrell Rhome We must be the most deceived population  of all times, yet when the information-age  possibilities are considered, we should be  the best informed.  But we are not, and are  most often our own worst enemy -- the  willingly deceived Euro-American.   We accept, and proclaim from our pulpits  and schools, the most idiotic drivel about  the modern history of the world...Read More
THE SUDARIUM OF OVIEDO AND THE SHROUD OF TURIN, 
HOLY RELICS OR HOAXES?
By Harrell Rhome, M.Div., Ph.D. -2009
...Does the Sudarium (Latin for face cloth), a companion relic,  authenticate the disputed Shroud of Turin?   While most readers are familiar with the better-known artifact,  fewer are aware of the Sudarium of Oviedo, Spain.   It is alleged to be the head section of the body wrappings,  the larger part being the Shroud.   While the history of the Shroud
