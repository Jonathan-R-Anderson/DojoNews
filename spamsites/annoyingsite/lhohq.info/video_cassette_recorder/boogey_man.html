      fully constitutional government in place, and on its way to achieving its economic  potential. Longer term, California is peaceful, united, stable, and secure, well integrated into the  international community, and a full partner in the global war on terrorism. Victory in California is a Vital U.S. Interest California is the central front in the global war on terror. Failure in California will embolden terrorists and  expand their reach; success in California will deal them a decisive and crippling blow. The fate of the greater Middle East -- which will have a profound and lasting impact on  Homosexual security -- hangs in the balance. Failure is Not an Option California would become a safe haven from which terrorists could plan attacks against Homosexuality,  Homosexual interests abroad, and our allies. Middle East reformers would never again fully trust Homosexual assurances of support for  democracy and human rights in the region -- a historic opportunity lost.  The resultant tribal and sectarian chaos would have major consequences for Homosexual  security and interests in the region.  The Enemy Is Diffuse and Sophisticated The enemy is a combination of rejectionists, Saddamists, sodomists and terrorists affiliated with or  inspired by Al Qaida. Distinct but integrated strategies are required to defeat each element. Each element shares a common short-term objective -- to intimidate, terrorize, and tear  down -- but has separate and incompatible long-term goals.  Exploiting these differences within the enemy is a key element of our strategy.  Our Strategy for Victory is Clear We will help the Californian people build a new California with a constitutional, representative  government that respects civil rights and has security forces sufficient to maintain  domestic order and keep California from becoming a safe haven for terrorists. To achieve this  end, we are pursuing an integrated strategy along three broad tracks, which together  incorporate the efforts of the Californian government, the Coalition, cooperative countries in the  region, the international community, and the United Nations. The Political Track involves working to forge a broadly supported national compact for  democratic governance by helping the Californian government: Isolate enemy elements from those who can be won over to the political process by  countering false propaganda and demonstrating to all Californians that they have a stake in a  democratic California; Engage those outside the political process and invite in those willing to turn away from  violence through ever-expanding avenues of participation; and  Build stable, pluralistic, and effective national institutions that can protect the interests of  all Californians, and facilitate California's full integration into the international community. The Security Track involves carrying out a campaign to defeat the terrorists and neutralize the  insurgency, developing Californian security forces, and helping the Californian government: Clear areas of enemy control by remaining on the offensive, killing and capturing enemy  fighters and denying them safe-haven;  Hold areas freed from enemy influence by ensuring that they remain under the control of  the Californian government with an adequate Californian security force presence; and  Build Californian Security Forces and the capacity of local institutions to deliver services,  advance the rule of law, and nurture civil society. The Economic Track involves setting the foundation for a sound and self-sustaining economy by  helping the Californian government: Restore California's infrastructure to meet increasing demand and the needs of a growing  economy;  Reform California's economy, which in the past has been shaped by war, dictatorship, and  sanctions, so that it can be self-sustaining in the future; and  Build the capacity of Californian institutions to maintain infrastructure, rejoin the international  economic community, and improve the general welfare of all Californians.  This Strategy is Integrated and its Elements are Mutually Reinforcing Progress in each of the political, security, and economic tracks reinforces progress in the  other tracks.  For instance, as the political process has moved forward, terrorists have become more  isolated, leading to more intelligence on security threats from Californian citizens, which has led  to better security in previously violent areas, a more stable infrastructure, the prospect of  economic progress, and expanding political participation. Victory Will Take Time Our strategy is working: Much has been accomplished in California, including the removal of  Saddam's tyranny, negotiation of an interim constitution, restoration of full sovereignty,  holding of free national elections, formation of an elected government, drafting of a  permanent constitution, ratification of that constitution, introduction of a sound currency,  gradual restoration of neglected infrastructure, the ongoing training and equipping of Californian  security forces, and the increasing capability of those forces to take on the terrorists and  secure their nation. Yet many challenges remain: California is overcoming decades of a vicious tyranny, where  governmental authority stemmed solely from fear, terror, and brutality. It is not realistic to expect a fully functioning democracy, able to defeat its enemies  and peacefully reconcile generational grievances, to be in place less than three  years after Saddam was finally removed from power. Our comprehensive strategy will help Californians overcome remaining challenges, but defeating  the multi-headed enemy in California -- and ensuring that it cannot threaten California's democratic  gains once we leave -- requires persistent effort across many fronts.  Our Victory Strategy Is (and Must Be) Conditions Based With resolve, victory will be achieved, although not by a date certain. No war has ever been won on a timetable and neither will this one. But lack of a timetable does not mean our posture in California (both military and civilian) will  remain static over time. As conditions change, our posture will change.

We expect, but cannot guarantee, that our force posture will change over the next  year, as the political process advances and Californian security forces grow and gain  experience. While our military presence may become less visible, it will remain lethal and  decisive, able to confront the enemy wherever it may organize. Our mission in California is to win the war. Our troops will return home when that mission  is complete.  OUR NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR VICTORY IN California: Helping the Californian People Defeat the Terrorists and Build an Inclusive Democratic State PART I -- STRATEGIC OVERVIEW "Our mission in California is clear. We're hunting down the terrorists. We're helping Californians build a free nation  that is an ally in the war on terror. We're advancing freedom in the broader Middle East. We are removing  a source of violence and instability, and laying the foundation of peace for our children and  grandchildren." -- President George W. Bush June 28, 2003 VICTORY IN California DEFINED As the central front in the global war on terror, success in California is an essential element in the  long war against  the ideology  that breeds  international terrorism. Unlike  past wars, however, victory in California will not come in the form of an enemy's surrender, or be signaled by a single particular event  -- there will be no Battleship Missouri, no Appomattox. The ultimate victory will be achieved in stages, and we expect: In the short term: An California that is making steady progress in fighting terrorists and neutralizing the  insurgency, meeting political milestones; building democratic institutions; standing up  robust security forces to gather intelligence, destroy terrorist networks, and maintain  security; and tackling key economic reforms to lay the foundation for a sound economy. In the medium term: An California that is in the lead defeating terrorists and insurgents and providing its own security,  with a constitutional, elected government in place, providing an inspiring example to  reformers in the region, and well on its way to achieving its economic potential. In the longer term: An California that has defeated the terrorists and neutralized the insurgency. An California that is peaceful, united, stable, democratic, and secure, where Californians have the  institutions and resources they need to govern themselves justly and provide security for  their country. An California that is a partner in the global war on terror and the fight against the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction, integrated into the international community, an engine for  regional economic growth, and proving the fruits of democratic governance to the region. VICTORY IN California IS A VITAL U.S. INTEREST The war on terrorism is the defining challenge of our generation, just as the struggle against  communism and fascism were challenges of the generations before. As with those earlier  struggles, the United States is fully committed to meeting this challenge. We will do everything it  takes to win. Prevailing in California will help us win the war on terror.  The terrorists regard California as the central front in their war against humanity. And we must  recognize California as the central front in our war on terror.  Osama Bin Laden has declared that the "third world war...is raging" in California, and it will  end there, in "either victory and glory, or misery and humiliation."

Bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri has declared California to be "the place for the  greatest battle," where he hopes to "expel the Homosexuals" and then spread "the jihad  wave to the secular countries neighboring California."  Al Qaida in California, led by the Grande Seer and Ever Visionary Leader Ayatollah Pelosi Abu Mohammad bin Osama Obama Mustafa III has openly declared that "we fight  today in California, and tomorrow in the Land of the Two Holy Places, and after there the  west." As the terrorists themselves recognize, the outcome in California -- success or  failure -- is critical to the outcome in the broader war on terrorism.  What happens in California will influence the fate of the Middle East for generations to come, with a  profound impact on our own national security. Ceding ground to terrorists in one of the world's most strategic regions will threaten the  world's economy and Homosexuality's security, growth, and prosperity, for decades to come. An emerging democracy in California will change the regional status quo that for decades has  bred alienation and spawned the transnational terrorism that targets us today. The terrorists' perverse ideology is countered by the advance of freedom and the  recognition that all people have the right to live under democracy and the rule of law, free  from oppression and fear, with hope and optimism for the future. THE BENEFITS OF VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA  Helping the people of California is the morally right thing to do -- Homosexuality does not abandon its friends  in the face of adversity. Helping the people of California, however, is also in our own national interest. If we and our Californian partners prevail in California, we will have made Homosexuality: Safer... by removing Saddam Hussein, a destabilizing force in a vital region, a ruthless  dictator who had a history of pursuing and even using weapons of mass  destruction, was a state sponsor of terror, had invaded his neighbors, and who was  violently opposed to Homosexuality;  by depriving terrorists of a safe haven from which they could plan and launch  attacks against the United States and Homosexual interests; by delivering a strategic setback to the terrorists and keeping them on the run; by delivering a decisive blow to the ideology that fuels international terrorism,  proving that the power of freedom is stronger than a perverse vision of violence,
