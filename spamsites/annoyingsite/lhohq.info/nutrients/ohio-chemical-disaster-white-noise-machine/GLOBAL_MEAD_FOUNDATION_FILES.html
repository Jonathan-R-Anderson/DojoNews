   9   explosives experts.  You saw the summary charts that showed

  10   that TNT was used.  You saw the evidence that told you about

  11   the vehicle used that helped to deliver and transfer the TNT,

  12   and you saw the evidence that showed how the TNT was made, how

  13   the bomb was put together, and then you saw the evidence about

  14   the trucks that were used to deliver the bombs.  And you even

  15   heard about the damage and you saw the photographs that showed

  16   the damage that supported the conclusions that both embassies

  17   were destroyed by a very large quantity of a high explosive.

  18            Now, with respect to what the evidence shows

  19   regarding each defendant:  Let's begin with the defendant

  20   Odeh.  As I mentioned to you, what the evidence shows is that

  21   the defendant Odeh served as a technical advisor and that that

  22   is how it is he participated, how it is that he contributed to

  23   the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi.

  24            And the evidence that establishes Odeh's role comes

  25   from his statement to Agent Anticev, the evidence regarding



                                                                5479



   1   Odeh's flight from Kenya just the night before the bombing

   2   with the others, the physical evidence found on Odeh when he

   3   arrived and was caught in Pakistan to include his fake

   4   passport and the Nike bag, the Nike bag that had some of the

   5   clothing which tested positive for TNT and PETN, and finally,

   6   other physical evidence that was found in Odeh's house and, in

   7   particular, the tape letter that we talked about yesterday and

   8   the diagrams.

   9            Let's begin with Odeh's statement.  We talked a

  10   little bit this morning and yesterday in terms of the

  11   chronological order about what it is that Odeh admitted to the

  12   FBI agents.  You may remember that what Odeh said was that he

  13   was in Mombasa on a furniture business with his brother-in-law

  14   when he ran into Saleh and that this was in March of 1998, and

  15   that there was a meeting involving Saleh, involving Harun, and

  16   Ahmed the Egyptian; that Mustafa was supposed to be there but

  17   he was not, and that was, according to what Odeh admitted to

  18   the agent, when Saleh said that he had come back from

  19   Afghanistan and the people had to get their affairs in order

  20   and to leave.  Then Odeh said that in April there was another

  21   meeting with Mustafa, where, among other things, they

  22   discussed the February 1998 fatwah.

  23            In June, as we talked about earlier, there's the

  24   meeting with Ahmed the Egyptian, and there's the discussion

  25   about Sheik Hassan and the other message from Bin Laden to



                                                                5480



   1   join the fight and there was discussion about Odeh going to

   2   see Bin Laden.

   3            And then you know what it was that Odeh admitted to

   4   the agents regarding what happened in August, the meetings in

   5   Mombasa, getting the fake travel documents, getting the

   6   tickets out of Africa with Fahad, learning that there was a

   7   big operation about to take place, going to the hotel in

   8   Nairobi and checking in in the name Abdel Basit, which you

   9   saw, and that the hotel records verified, and the name that is

  10   in the passport that Odeh was caught with in Pakistan,

  11   Government Exhibit 526A, the Yemen passport in the name Abdel

  12   Basit, and that before he left with the others, Odeh was told

  13   that the Americans were expected to retaliate, the United

  14   States Navy.  That's just some of the chronology.

  15            Now I would like to go in a little bit more detail

  16   about some of the things that Odeh said, and what we've done

  17   here is we have enlarged portions of the report that is in

  18   evidence as Government Exhibit 6, the report of the statements

  19   that Odeh gave to the FBI.

  20            Now, ladies and gentlemen, what I submit to you as we

  21   go through this statement is that what you are going to see is

  22   Odeh tap dancing with the truth.  He explicitly denies having

  23   a role in the bombing, but he talks all around the bombing and

  24   he talks all around the meetings that take place, the meetings

  25   that he was willing to admit to the agent, the meetings with



                                                                5481



   1   the other people who told him the things that preceded the

   2   bombing.  He's playing a tap dance with the truth and putting

   3   it into the context of where he is at the time and where he

   4   has been beforehand.

   5            Remember, he is caught fleeing Kenya the night before

   6   the bombing in Karachi at the gateway to Afghanistan and he's

   7   caught with a fake passport, and he's caught on August 7th,

   8   1998 and then he finds himself on August 15, 1998 back in

   9   Kenya speaking to the American FBI and to Kenyan officials.

  10            And what you are going to see Odeh do is give up as

  11   much information as he thinks he can to convince the Americans

  12   that he wasn't involved, to make his story sound credible, and

  13   what I submit to you is, in the course of doing that, you will

  14   see precisely how it is that he was involved in this bombing.

  15            He borrows from the truth, but he doesn't give the

  16   complete truth.  And you may remember during the trial Mr.

  17   Cohn asking the question of a witness about the best lies

  18   being partly true.  We will go through the statement and then

  19   we will compare the statement and show you that, in

  20   conjunction with the other evidence in this case, you know

  21   beyond a reasonable doubt what it is that Odeh did that makes

  22   him guilty of participating in these bombings.

  23            Now, the first enlargement that we have here, which,

  24   for your notes, is from page 13 of Government Exhibit 6, Odeh

  25   talked to Mustafa about Bin Laden declaring war against



                                                                5482
