  16            "Knowingly" creating such a risk means that

  17   Mr. al-'Owhali was conscious and aware that his conduct in the

  18   course of committing the offense might have this result.

  19   Mr. al-'Owhali's conduct cannot merely have been the product

  20   of ignorance, mistake or accident.  Knowledge must be proved

  21   like anything else.  You may consider any statements made and

  22   acts done by Mr. al-'Owhali, and all the facts and

  23   circumstances in evidence which may aid you in the

  24   determination of Mr. al-'Owhali's knowledge.

  25            "Grave risk of death" means a significant and




                                                                7244


   1   considerable possibility that another person might be killed.

   2   In order to find that the government has proven this factor

   3   beyond a reasonable doubt, you must unanimously agree on a

   4   particular person or a class of persons who were placed in

   5   danger by Mr. al-'Owhali's actions.

   6            "Persons in addition to the victims" include innocent

   7   bystanders in the zone of danger created by the defendant's

   8   acts, but do not include other participants in the offense.

   9            Your finding as to this statutory aggravating factor

  10   must be indicated in the appropriate space in Section II, Part

  11   A.2 of the Special Verdict Form.

  12            The third statutory aggravating factor alleged by the

  13   government with regard to the capital counts is that the

  14   defendant committed the offenses under the particular counts

  15   after substantial planning and premeditation to cause the

  16   death of a person or to commit an act of terrorism.

  17            "Planning" means mentally formulating a method for

  18   doing something or achieving some end.

  19            "Substantial planning and premeditation" means a

  20   considerable or significant amount of planning and

  21   premeditation.

  22            An "act of terrorism" is an act calculated to

  23   influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation

  24   or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.

  25            I'm told I skipped premeditation, which I didn't




                                                                7245


   1   premeditatively do that.

   2            "Premeditation" means thinking or deliberating about

   3   something and deciding whether to do it beforehand.

   4            To find that the government has satisfied its burden

   5   of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. al-'Owhali

   6   engaged in substantial planning and premeditation either to

   7   cause the death of a person or to commit an act of terrorism,

   8   you must unanimously agree on the particular object of the

   9   substantial planning and premeditation either to cause the

  10   death of a person, to commit an act of terrorism, or to do

  11   both.  Your finding as to this statutory aggravating factor

  12   must be indicated in the appropriate space in the Section II,

  13   Part A.3 of the Special Verdict Form.

  14            The fourth and final statutory aggravating factor

  15   alleged by the government with regard to the capital counts is

  16   that the defendant intentionally killed or attempted to kill

  17   more than one person in a single criminal episode.

  18            To establish the existence of this factor, the

  19   government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that

  20   Mr. al-'Owhali intentionally killed or attempted to kill more

  21   than one person in a single criminal episode.  You must

  22   unanimously agree on the particular actual or intended victims

  23   or a class of intended victims in order to find that this

  24   factor has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

  25            "Intentionally killing" a person means killing a




                                                                7246


   1   person on purpose, that is:  Willfully, deliberately, or with

   2   a conscious desire to cause a person's death (and not just

   3   accidentally or involuntarily).

   4            "Attempting to kill" a person means purposely doing

   5   some act which constitutes a substantial step (beyond mere

   6   preparation or planning) toward killing a person, and doing so

   7   with the intent to cause a person's death.  You may not find

   8   that the defendant attempted to kill a person who was actually

   9   killed.

  10            "A single criminal episode" is an act or series of

  11   related criminal acts which occur within a relatively limited

  12   time and place, or are directed at the same person or persons,

  13   or are part of a continuous course of conduct related in time,

  14   place, or purpose.

  15            You may, but are not required to, infer that a person

  16   of sound mind intended the ordinary, natural, and probable

  17   consequences of his knowing and voluntary acts.  Thus, you may
