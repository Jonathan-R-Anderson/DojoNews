<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  11   Americans from the Gulf, exactly the way al Fadl described it

  12   for you.  You saw it in a different form.  When Khalfan Khamis

  13   Mohamed was asked does it occur to you that you were going to

  14   kill Tanzanians and not Americans, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed said

  15   yes, that's part of the job, but if they're innocent, Allah

  16   will take care of them, and if they're not, then they are

  17   going to get what they deserve.  That's exactly what al Fadl

  18   said Abu Hajer told the group.  If they are innocent, they

  19   will go to paradise.  If not, they will get what they deserve.

  20            Is this really Islamically correct?  I don't know.

  21   But is it what Al Qaeda believed?  Absolutely.  And once they

  22   adopt that belief, it makes perfect sense that they would

  23   carry out among other things the operation of East Africa in

  24   August of 1998.

  25            So once Bin Laden and Abu Hajer raise a call to arms



                                                                5255



   1   with respect to Somalia, Somalia becomes a magnet for Al Qaeda

   2   people.  Jamal al-Fadl described for you that Abu Hafs the

   3   military commander took two trips.  The first was for all

   4   practical purposes a scouting mission.  When he came back from

   5   this trip he told Jamal al-Fadl that I went down there, I

   6   don't think we can take America head on.  This is what Jamal

   7   al-Fadl said.  He said there are different tribes down there.

   8   There is no one in control.  But we will start a little bit

   9   and if it goes good we'll go bigger.

  10            You know, the witness Dr. Samatar described for you

  11   the situation in Somalia, that there were many tribes and that

  12   they were fighting amongst each other and fighting

  13   collectively against other tribes.  That is exactly what Abu

  14   Hafs recognized when he went there.

  15            Ladies and gentlemen, Al Qaeda didn't storm the

  16   beaches with an army and we are not submitting to you that Al

  17   Qaeda members were the ones that fired the rockets or the

  18   bullets or set off the mines.  What we are saying to you is

  19   that Al Qaeda sent people to Somalia to pursue its goal to

  20   drive the Americans out of Somalia.  If that meant training

  21   people to carry out operations, that's what they would do.  If

  22   it meant training some who would train others, that's what

  23   they would do.

  24            At bottom what this reflects is that as far back as

  25   1993, Al Qaeda is going to focus wherever America is and do



                                                                5256



   1   whatever it thinks it can to carry out its mission.  Abu Hafs

   2   recognized the need and the limitations, but nonetheless, as

   3   you will see, Al Qaeda did what it could to drive the

   4   Americans out.

   5            In fact, Jamal al-Fadl described a second trip that

   6   Abu Hafs took, and when he returned from the second trip he

   7   said that Al Qaeda was responsible for what happened to the

   8   Americans.  Again, does that mean he is saying that Al Qaeda

   9   members were the ones that fired the guns?  Not necessarily.

  10   They are responsible, whether or not he is even telling the

  11   truth, feel responsible, which tells you a great deal about

  12   their mind set.

  13            When the call to arms goes out, help comes from

  14   everywhere.  From Khartoum -- again, we are talking about

  15   1993 -- you remember the testimony of Essam al Ridi, the pilot

  16   who was called by Wadih El Hage when he was back in Texas to

  17   see about buying a plane for Bin Laden.  One of the things

  18   that El Hage asked Essam al Ridi was if a plane would have

  19   enough range to go from Pakistan to Sudan because he wanted to

  20   know if Essam al Ridi would help deliver Stinger missiles from

  21   Pakistan to Sudan, at precisely the same time that American

  22   forces are in Somalia.

  23            The other thing that Essam al Ridi told you was after

  24   he bought the plane and brought it to Khartoum, Wadih El Hage

  25   asked him to fly five members of Al Qaeda from Khartoum to
