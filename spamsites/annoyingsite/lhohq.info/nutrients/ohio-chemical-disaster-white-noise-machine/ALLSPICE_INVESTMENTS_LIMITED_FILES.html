  13            THE COURT:  If it just says you should tell us

  14   that -- in your language, then it seems to me we withhold from

  15   them the consequences of that, and it seems to me it makes the

  16   process fairer and more informed if they know that the

  17   consequence of that is not that it goes to another jury, which

  18   is what classically happens, but rather that it is

  19   dispositive.

  20            I debated including, in other words, putting in after

  21   you check the first box, in other words, the law on this

  22   subject is that if the jury is not unanimously in favor of

  23   death, then the jury is unanimous in favor of life

  24   imprisonment.  There is no such thing as a hung jury in a

  25   death penalty proceeding.




                                                                7310


   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I understand the concept

   2   but I don't think that is accurate.  If the jurors, whatever

   3   number there might be, are divided --

   4            THE COURT:  Well, could we say, this is because --

   5   you should check the first box on page 15.  This is because

   6   the consequence of a lack of unanimity in favoring death is a

   7   verdict in favor of life imprisonment.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, it is not a verdict.

   9   The holding in Jones is that the deliberative process has

  10   broken down.

  11            THE COURT:  We have agreed that the substance is that

  12   the verdict is life imprisonment, and I don't know whether the

  13   difference that you make is a public relations difference, a

  14   difference with respect to the next jury phase, what --

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  Two points, Judge.

  16            THE COURT:  Yes.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  The courts talk about an interest in

  18   finality.  Two things.  If the jury is deadlocked, I think we

  19   should have a note indicating they are deadlocked and an

  20   opportunity to have an Allen charge given, trying to reach a

  21   verdict in good conscience.  Number one.  Number two, it is

  22   not good public relations for us to get a right answer.  I

  23   think the jury is entitled to know if it is life imprisonment,

  24   but more important we need to know whether there is a

  25   deadlock, which could be an intellectual question, that there




                                                                7311


   1   is a problem here.

   2            These three choices on the verdict form assume a

   3   unanimous decision has been reached.  If you cannot reach a

   4   unanimous decision, you are to let us know by note and the

   5   parties and the court can proceed from there.  But I don't

   6   think we should assume that they are deadlocked or take

   7   deadlocked as being unanimously against the death penalty.  I

   8   think we need to qualify whatever language is used by count in

   9   the unlikely event that there is a split by count.

  10            (Pause)

  11            THE COURT:  Let me read it again:  Ladies and

  12   gentlemen of the jury.  The charge correctly informs you, page

  13   28, line 1, that if you do not unanimously find beyond a

  14   reasonable doubt that the death sentence should be imposed,

  15   you should indicate this in section V of the special verdict

  16   form.  Let me elaborate on how this is done.  If the jury has

  17   not unanimously found that death is the appropriate sentence,

  18   then the government has failed to prove that death is

  19   appropriate to your unanimous satisfaction.  If this is the

  20   case, then your verdict is that Al-'Owhali should be sentenced

  21   to life imprisonment and you should check the first box on

  22   page 15.  This is because the consequence of a lack of

  23   unanimity in favor of death is a verdict in favor of life

  24   imprisonment.  Before you reach any conclusion based on a lack

  25   of unanimity in favor of a death sentence, you should continue




                                                                7312


   1   your discussions until you are fully satisfied that further

   2   discussion will not yield a unanimous verdict in favor of

   3   death.  Again, you are to consider this separately as to each
