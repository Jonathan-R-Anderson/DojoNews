  16   when you think about form over substance -- Kherchtou is asked

  17   by Mr. Schmidt, transcript at 1413:

  18            "Did you become aware that Harun," Harun, "was

  19   involved in false passports or other fraudulent documents?"

  20            "Kherchtou:  Yes.

  21            "Mr. Schmidt:  Did you ever see Wadih El Hage

  22   involved with false passports?

  23            "Kherchtou:  No."

  24            Kherchtou didn't know.  Kherchtou didn't see the

  25   letter you saw going back and forth, that Libyan guy in



                                                                5905



   1   Azerbaijan.  There was a wiretap you saw conversations of

   2   where Wadih El Hage is involved with a DHL, sending a package

   3   and fixing the office and cleaning the green.

   4            Wadih El Hage, even Mr. Schmidt seems to concede, was

   5   involved with passports when he says, "It doesn't really

   6   matter, because that's okay in the third world.  Only you

   7   suspicious Americans think that's something bad."  I submit to

   8   you, Kherchtou didn't know as much as you did and you will see

   9   that throughout; that you have seen so many different pieces

  10   of the puzzle that you now know about particular things more

  11   than any one witness.  And if Kherchtou wanted to make it up,

  12   wouldn't he have just said, yeah, I saw Wadih do passports?

  13   But he didn't.  He told you what he knew and what he didn't

  14   know.

  15            Kherchtou told you that he sat in Wadih El Hage's

  16   house with Ali Mohamed, a person Abu Mohamed al Amriki,

  17   several pictures of him, the guy who did the surveillance, and

  18   said that the military commander wanted Kherchtou and Ali

  19   Mohamed to go over to Senegal and surveil targets.  He never

  20   reached.  He said Wadih El Hage was present.  He was in his

  21   house.  He could have.  Wadih El Hage would be in the area.

  22   He doesn't have to worry.  But he doesn't.

  23            And you will see later that when Kherchtou told you

  24   the story about al Fawwaz being arrested, he told you that

  25   they paid bribes, they went to a lawyer and they went to a



                                                                5906



   1   contact in the Kenyan Intelligence Service, a guy named Ali.

   2   He never once indicated that Wadih El Hage knew Ali or knew

   3   about him.  And yet when you look through Wadih El Hage's

   4   notebooks you will see later on that Wadih El Hage had an

   5   entry in his notebook that said, "Ali from Kenyan Intelligence

   6   can help us with the organization."  Kherchtou didn't reach.

   7            Now, I submit to you the one thing that Mr. Schmidt

   8   cannot accept is that Mr. Kherchtou believes but doesn't know,

   9   but believes that Wadih El Hage is a member of al Qaeda.  And

  10   let's talk about form over substance, because it's

  11   interesting.

  12            On the government's direct examination, I will cite

  13   transcript 76.  You can check it.  Kherchtou is asked right up

  14   front:

  15            "Do you know if Wadih El Hage made bayat?"  He said
