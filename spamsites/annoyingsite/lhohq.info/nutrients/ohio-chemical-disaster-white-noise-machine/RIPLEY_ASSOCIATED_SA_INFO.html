   9   that fair to say?

  10   A.  That's fair to say.

  11   Q.  We're not talking about like a paved road or something to

  12   that effect; is that right?

  13   A.  Portions of it are paved, portions of it are not.

  14   Q.  And how long did it take you to get the from Lamu to Witu?

  15   A.  Approximately an hour and a half.

  16   Q.  And was there traffic coming the other way at all?

  17   A.  There was some traffic, yes.

  18   Q.  There would be buses or lories, trucks coming the other

  19   way?

  20   A.  Correct.

  21   Q.  And were the Kenya individuals, were some of them armed

  22   with weapons?

  23   A.  The military escort we had, yes.

  24   Q.  And the reason that you had a military escort was there

  25   was some concern that you might have the need for a military



                                                                1824



   1   escort; is that correct?

   2   A.  I believe there was some concern about security, yes.

   3   Q.  When you were in this area did you ever get down to

   4   Malindi?  Can you see that on the map?

   5   A.  I see it on the map.  I did not go there.

   6   Q.  Was it discussed that when you would go to Witu that you

   7   would go from Lamu to Witu when you were directed to go?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  Was there any discussion about taking this road from

  10   Malindi?

  11   A.  No.

  12   Q.  Because that would appear to be a much longer way to go;

  13   is that right?

  14   A.  It appears it from the map, yes.

  15   Q.  And were there any other villages on the way from Lamu to

  16   Witu?

  17   A.  To the best of my recollection, there may have been one or

  18   two small villages just off the road, you know, that could

  19   have been set back a little bit that I seem to recall seeing

  20   some houses.  I don't know if you could accurately describe

  21   them as villages.

  22   Q.  Okay.  Lamu itself is a good-sized town, one might say?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  I mean, there are buildings there and shops and hotels and

  25   that type of thing?



                                                                1825



   1   A.  That's correct.

   2   Q.  Restaurants?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  Did you actually stay overnight in Lamu?

   5   A.  No.

   6   Q.  And on the way from Lamu to Witu, over this hour and a

   7   half, you said you maybe saw some scattered dwellings; is that

   8   right?

   9   A.  That's correct.

  10   Q.  But basically you are going back into the interior of

  11   Kenya; is that correct?

  12   A.  I guess that would be a fair statement, yes.

  13   Q.  When you get to Witu, is there a sign there that says

  14   "entering Witu" or anything like that?

  15   A.  Not that I recall.

  16   Q.  Witu is basically -- the road widens to some extent and

  17   you see some houses over to the left; is that right?

  18   A.  It was a, I would call it a fair-sized village.

  19   Q.  And the village was primarily composed of huts; is that

  20   correct?

  21   A.  I would say actually the buildings were mostly as depicted

  22   in the photographs, some kind of stucco wall construction, but

  23   thatched roofing.

  24   Q.  Okay.  So most of the buildings in this village looked

  25   like the residence that you were going to search; is that



                                                                1826



   1   correct?

   2   A.  Similar to that, yes.

   3   Q.  Were you told that what appeared to be stucco is

   4   essentially mud that was painted over or --

   5   A.  It may well have been.  I'm using "stucco" as a

   6   descriptive term, not as what it definitively is.

   7   Q.  Okay.  Well, before you were given this assignment to go

   8   to Witu, were you told, you know, what kind of tools or

   9   equipment would be appropriate to bring?

  10   A.  We were told that we were going to search a residence, so

  11   we brought the equipment we normally would take to support

  12   that.

  13   Q.  Was it in your mind that you would have to perhaps break

  14   into the residence?

  15   A.  No.

  16   Q.  Were you confident at that point that you would be

  17   admitted entry into the residence without any resistance?

  18   A.  Yes.
