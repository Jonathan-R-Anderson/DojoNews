   9   A.  Yes, Khost area.

  10   Q.  And there again, they talked to you, various people talked

  11   to you about religious issues, didn't they?

  12   A.  Yes, in Farouq camp.

  13   Q.  And one of the things they talked to you about was

  14   something I think you referred to as a khalifa, right?

  15   A.  Khalifa.  Al khalifa, yes.

  16   Q.  And "khalifa" means that all of the Muslim world should be

  17   united into a single -- I'm going to use the word country, but

  18   it really means a single entity?

  19   A.  You're right.

  20   Q.  And you believed that, didn't you?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  You believed, for example, that whatever country you were

  23   from, in your case, the Sudan, wasn't as important as the

  24   unity Muslims should have for one another?

  25   A.  I don't understand that.



                                                                506



   1   Q.  Well, Sudan is a nation, right?

   2   A.  Yes, it's country.

   3   Q.  Egypt is another nation?

   4   A.  Another country, yes.

   5   Q.  Somalia is another country?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  But when you talk about khalifa, what you say is all

   8   Muslims should be joined together?

   9   A.  You're right, under one man.

  10   Q.  Under one man, a khalifa?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And that was one of the goals of al Qaeda, wasn't it?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  And it was a goal you accepted?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  So you believed that countries that wouldn't accept that

  17   idea were in the wrong, didn't you?

  18   A.  Could you repeat?

  19   Q.  Yes.

  20            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  21   A.  With a little explain more.  You right, but with a little

  22   explanation.

  23   Q.  Okay.  Well, I'll ask you if I want the explanation, but

  24   that's the general idea, isn't it?

  25   A.  Not exactly, but you're right.
