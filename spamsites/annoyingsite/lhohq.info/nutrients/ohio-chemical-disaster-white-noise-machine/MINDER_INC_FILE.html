  17            MR. GARCIA:  Your Honor, in conjunction with the

  18   State Department, I think under a similar scheme as the

  19   Department of Defense, the regulations provide for input from

  20   the Justice Department when these agents are subpoenaed.

  21            THE COURT:  My inclination, just as yesterday with

  22   the subpoenas of AFP -- the issue was readily resolved after

  23   the subpoena was issued.  My inclination is to sign the

  24   subpoena, which I have not yet done, to make it very clear, as

  25   I did with the subpoenas on the media, that I am imposing no



                                                                4212



   1   court imprimatur on the subpoenas.  I am not ruling on any of

   2   the many weighty objections that might be made to the subpoena

   3   both with respect to the subject matter, with respect to

   4   whether she is a proper or not or not.  But if we discover

   5   that she too has prior plans or commitments which would

   6   preclude her being here, what might be very profound legal

   7   issues would disappear.

   8            So that is what I would propose doing, but if anyone

   9   objects to that I would hear you.

  10            MR. BAUGH:  I do wish to note, your Honor, that

  11   unlike Mr. Schmidt's application for the issuance of a

  12   subpoena for a retired general, we have issued a subpoena in

  13   the punishment phase of the death case.  Quite candidly, if

  14   this were a subpoena for Joe the Ragman, they would be brought

  15   here and I can find no distinction in the statute that because

  16   this person Madeleine Albright is a former lofty ambassador of

  17   good standing in our nation there is no difference in their

  18   obligation --

  19            THE COURT:  You want to argue the merits now.  You

  20   know, I can't win.  You want me to sign a subpoena.  I have

  21   said I think I should sign the subpoena.  Now you want to

  22   object to my doing that?

  23            MR. BAUGH:  My concern was the caveat you put after

  24   that, and that is if Mrs. Albright, if an ambassador has a

  25   scheduling problem and if she is the best witness for this



                                                                4213



   1   issue, then at that juncture, rather than try to bring in

   2   someone else, we will either have her made available or

   3   continue the matter until she can become available.

   4            THE COURT:  That is really incredible, that you

   5   should make that point now.  You know, I have tried to suggest

   6   that it may be entirely unnecessary and counterproductive to

   7   deal with these matters in the abstract.

   8            MR. BAUGH:  I agree, your Honor.

   9            THE COURT:  Unless you want me to rule on the merits

  10   of all these issues in the abstract, but I do not think that

  11   would be a prudent course for you to follow.

  12            MR. BAUGH:  Nor I, your Honor, but I don't want the

  13   court to assume, as the government did in its response, that

  14   by acquiescing to certain statements by the court and not

  15   responding to them in the record at this time that I am

  16   conceding those issues, and the government seems to assert

  17   that in its responsive pleading.  As long as we have that

  18   understanding, your Honor, I am ready to sit down.

  19            THE COURT:  Is there any objection to my signing the

  20   subpoena, understanding the reason why I sign it is simply to

  21   move the matter forward to the next step and without in any

  22   way indicating that I think that she is a proper party, that

  23   service will be made in the proper fashion or any and all

  24   other defenses that might be made?

  25            MR. GARCIA:  No, your Honor, I certainly understand



                                                                4214



   1   that.  One point, not to be argumentative.  I think what we

   2   are seeing with a lot of these subpoenas, and Mr. Schmidt's

   3   subpoena, is a complete disregard for the CFR regulations,

   4   which provide a basis to quash and for requesting the

   5   information that is put forward, which seems to serve a

   6   twofold purpose.  One is to protect the government and give a

   7   basis for moving to quash, and the other is to give the

   8   defendant a basis to say that this is relevant material and it

   9   is relevant to my defense.  Without that we are going to be in

  10   a posture where the State Department, like the Department of

  11   Defense, is going to come back and say the notice is

  12   defective, we don't know what they want, we don't know what

  13   the relevancy is.  I understand, your Honor, that we are

  14   pushing that day off, but by doing that we are getting by a

  15   preliminary hurdle that might focus the issues at a later

  16   date.

  17            THE COURT:  I am not sure.  You know, the cases all

  18   deal -- not all, but primarily deal with quashing.  There is

  19   nothing to quash until a subpoena is in fact signed.  My

  20   efforts, really in the interests of expedition, to

  21   shortcircuit, I think have not been fruitful.

  22            If you resubmit the subpoena I will sign it, as I

  23   say, reserving to both sides all rights.

  24            Anything further?

  25            MR. GARCIA:  Nothing.  Thank you.



                                                                4215



   1            THE COURT:  Thank you.

   2            (Adjourned until 10:00 a.m., Wednesday, April 18,

   3   2001)
