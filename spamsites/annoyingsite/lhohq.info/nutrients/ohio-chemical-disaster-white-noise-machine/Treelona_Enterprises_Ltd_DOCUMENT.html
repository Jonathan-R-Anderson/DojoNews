  14   because they don't like each other, and he mad because they

  15   change the government, and he came to the government because

  16   they make a vote and he win.  But in '89, the Islamic National

  17   Front, they got relationship with military --

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, objection.  I don't think

  19   the witness was in the Sudan since 1986.  So I would object to

   2   sometimes because I work for this government.  I got

   3   information from different ways.

   4            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor.

   6   you about Saddiq al Mahdi specifically?

  18   Sudani, were both told by Dr. Abdel Munim al Khabir, we need

  19   you to start relationship with Umma Party.
