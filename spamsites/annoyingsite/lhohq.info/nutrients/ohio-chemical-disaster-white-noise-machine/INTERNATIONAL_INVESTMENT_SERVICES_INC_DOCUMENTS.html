   1   dressing up.  I went to church, as was our practice.  I went

   2   to church for the morning service and I went to my place of

   3   work.

   4   Q   Could you tell us what happened when the bomb went off

   5   that day.

   6   A   When the bomb went off, I was in my office reading the

   7   morning daily.  My son who was with me in the building had

   8   just gone off to driving school.  When I heard the first blast

   9   I got out of the building, out of my office, and as I opened

  10   the door to leave the office I heard people coming -- my

  11   office was the ninth floor, and they were praying, Hail Mary

  12   full of grace, the Lord be with you.  And I joined them in

  13   prayer.  I did not know what they were praying about.  I just

  14   thought that a tire burst, and I was waiting out of curiosity.

  15   Before I went far I heard the second blast.  There was

  16   darkness, fumes, and falling objects from upper floors.  I

  17   remember what I said.  I said God, whatever it is, cover us

  18   with the blood of Jesus, and for those who will not be able to

  19   make it, forgive them their sins and give them eternal rest.

  20            Through the darkness I made my way out of the

  21   building.  I knew which way to go.  As I got out of the

  22   building I saw people running from the direction of the

  23   embassy in the opposite way.  They were bleeding and crying.

  24   Nobody was able to explain what had happened.  I went down on

  25   my knees and prayed again.  I thanked God for saving my life.



                                                                6726



   1   I did not know that I was praying for my husband.  I did not

   2   know that moment in time that he was dead.

   3   Q   How did you learn that your husband had died that day?

   4   A   It took me more than four days to know that my husband was

   5   dead because we expected him to be there at that moment in

   6   time, because he had gone to his place of duty and by the time

   7   I was leaving the scene he had not shown up.  So I went home,

   8   hoping to hear from him or find him at home, or even get a

   9   telephone call.  Thomas was not at home.  That was not like

  10   him.  He always checked on us.  He always got in touch with

  11   anybody, a member of the family, to let them know that all was

  12   well.  We sat up the whole night, expecting him to come home,

  13   and he did not come home.

  14            That was the beginning of the search.  We went to all

  15   hospitals.  We did the city of Nairobi.  We went to the city

  16   mortuary and the mortuaries of the neighborhood, four, five

  17   times a day, finding bodies and checking and checking, for

  18   five days, with no success.  My husband's body was found among

  19   the last people to be retrieved in front of the Ufundi

  20   building, which had collapsed.  I got the message that the

  21   body has been found when I was in church, and I went down to

  22   the mortuary, not knowing what to expect.  I found him laying

  23   on the mortuary floor.  The T-shirt he had insisted on wearing

  24   was my means of identifying him.  Yes, he was wearing, "I am a

  25   Catholic and Jesus loves me."  He was very broken, but we



                                                                6727



   1   identified him by the T-shirt he was wearing.

   2            MR. GARCIA:  Your Honor, I have nothing further.

   3            MR. BAUGH:  No questions of this witness, your Honor.

   4            THE COURT:  Thank you.  You may step down.

   5            (Witness excused)

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  The government now calls Amos

   7   Murithi Karimi.

   8    AMOS MURITHI KARIMI,

   9        called as a witness by the government,

  10        having been duly sworn, testified as follows:
