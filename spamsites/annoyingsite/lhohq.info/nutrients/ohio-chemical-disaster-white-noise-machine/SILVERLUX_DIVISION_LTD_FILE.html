   1            THE COURT:  Yes.

   2   BY MR. COHN:

   3   Q   Now, you said on direct testimony that the government

   4   asked you to look for this document that you have now

   5   produced; is that right?

   6            MR. BUTLER:  Objection, your Honor.

   7            MR. COHN:  That was precisely his testimony.

   8            THE COURT:  Please.

   9            MR. COHN:  I'm sorry, your Honor.

  10            THE COURT:  Why don't you just ask the question

  11   without the preamble.

  12            MR. COHN:  Respectfully, I believe I'm entitled to

  13   ask it this way.

  14            THE COURT:  Go ahead.

  15            MR. COHN:  Thank you.

  16   Q   You said on direct that the government asked you to look

  17   for the document that you now produced; is that correct?

  18            MR. BUTLER:  Objection, your Honor.

  19   Q   And when did they make this request of you?

  20   A   The government never called me and told me I have to look

  21   for the document.

  22   Q   So it's now your testimony that you did this on your own?

  23            MR. BUTLER:  Objection, your Honor.

  24            THE COURT:  Sustained.  Stricken.

  25   Q   When did you commence looking for this document?



                                                                3997



   1   A   Are you asking me, myself, or the government?

   2   Q   You, yourself.

   3   A   At the same day he erased, he told me, and after he told

   4   me, I rewrite it.

   5            MR. COHN:  Can we have that read back?  I didn't

   6   understand it.

   7            THE COURT:  It will be stricken as non-responsive.

   8   No.

   9            You told us that after you returned to Kenya you

  10   looked for some further documents?

  11            THE WITNESS:  Yes.

  12            THE COURT:  When did you do that?

  13            THE WITNESS:  After I went back.

  14   BY MR. COHN:

  15   Q   Immediately after you went back?

  16   A   Yes.

  17   Q   And that was about a month and a half ago?

  18   A   I left here March 10 and I don't remember the exact date I

  19   did the search, but soon I discover it after I start the

  20   search.

  21            MR. COHN:  I have no further questions.

  22            MR. BUTLER:  Nothing further, your Honor.

  23            THE COURT:  Thank you.  You may step down.

  24            MR. BUTLER:  At this point I would ask if we could

  25   just put Government Exhibit 580A-6383 on one side of the



                                                                3998



   1   screen, and on the other side of the screen if we could put up

   2   Government Exhibit 575, which has been previously admitted

   3   into evidence, which is the landing card from the flight from

   4   Kenya into -- from Pakistan into Kenya.  And if we could

   5   highlight the signature at the bottom left-hand corner of

   6   Government Exhibit 580A and then the signature on Government

   7   Exhibit 575.

   8            Nothing further, your Honor.

   9            THE COURT:  Anything else?

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, the government rests.

  11            THE COURT:  The government rests.  The government

  12   rests subject to certain stipulations and certain statements

  13   that have been previously made to the Court.

  14            We'll be three minutes, and I'll see counsel and the

  15   reporter in the robing room.

   1            (In the robing room)

   2            THE COURT:  The Court has previously heard oral

   3   argument on the government's motion pursuant to Rule 29.  The

   4   government has also been heard, and the Court made various

   5   rulings at that time, all of which the Court reaffirms and

   6   reasserts.

   7            The only matter which was left unresolved was the

   8   jurisdictional challenge to the last count in the indictment,

   9   as to which the Court has reserved decision pending

  10   submissions by the parties.

  11            The Court finds at the conclusion of the government's

  12   case that the government has made an adequate showing of the

  13   existence of a conspiracy and that the statements which were

  14   received in evidence were statements made by coconspirators

  15   during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.

  16            Thank you.

  17            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, you might want to correct.

  18   You misspoke and said it was the government's motion and it --
