  24   threshhold is crossed by you unanimously finding one gateway

   1   that count is over.

   2            If there is no capital count for which you

   3   unanimously find the gateway factor has been proven beyond a

   4   reasonable doubt, skip forward to Section VI, and complete

   5   that Section in accordance with the directions there.  Then

   6   notify the Court you have completed your deliberations.  If

   7   you found at least one gateway factor with regard to one or

   8   more capital counts, continue on to Section II.

  10   with statutory aggravating factors.

  11            If and only if you unanimously find that the

  12   government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that at least

  13   one of the four gateway factors exists as to a particular

  14   capital count, you must then proceed to determine whether the

  15   government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the existence

  16   of any of the following four statutory aggravating factors

  17   with respect to that count.

  18            1.  The deaths, and injuries resulting in death,

  19   occurred during the commission or attempted commission of

  20   another offense, namely one of the following offenses listed

  21   under Title 18, United States Code, Section.  Then it lists

  22   them.

  23            2.  The defendant in the commission of the offense

  24   knowingly created a grave risk of death to one or more persons

  25   in addition to the victims of the offense.




                                                                7236


   1            3.  The defendant committed the offense after

   2   substantial planning and premeditation to cause the death of

   3   one or more persons or to commit an act of terrorism.

   4            4.  The defendant intentionally killed or attempted

   5   to kill more than one person in a single episode.

   6            At this point the law directs you to consider and

   7   decide, separately as to each of the capital counts for which

   8   you have unanimously found the existence of at least one

   9   gateway factor, the existence or nonexistence of the statutory

  10   aggravating factors specifically claimed by the government.

  11            You are reminded that to find the existence of a
