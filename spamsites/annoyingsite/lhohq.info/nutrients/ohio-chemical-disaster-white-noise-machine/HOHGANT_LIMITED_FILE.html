   1   application for a continuance and that I was available, and

   2   what is the story?

   3            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, we had further discussions

   4   with the government yesterday.  As to some of the material

   5   concerning statements made by others, whether exculpatory or

   6   806 or impeachment, the government told me yesterday that they

   7   have been reviewing the documents and they are going to make

   8   them available as soon as they complete their review.  I'm not

   9   sure exactly when that is.

  10            The reason why it took them until now, the government

  11   obviously have been pressing their case and they now seem to

  12   be working on it.  I don't have an answer when they are going

  13   to have that material turned over to us.  So maybe they can

  14   answer that question.

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, as to those materials to

  16   which he is entitled, we are reviewing them to determine what

  17   he is entitled to.  We intend to have them available -- today

  18   is Thursday -- a week from tomorrow.  We have to focus on the

  19   April 3rd submission, the bifurcation motion for Mr. Ruhnke,

  20   and then the 806 demands and the demands for review of any

  21   materials that may exist that may contain Brady with regard to

  22   his client.

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  As to receipt of it, if the material

  24   itself is self-inclusive and you decide that we are free to

  25   use it and we can either get a stipulation that the witness is


                  SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS (212) 805-0300
                                                                3562
       13tlbin2


   1   available, that will not present any problems.  If the

   2   material is something that requires us to go another step,

   3   which we don't know now, it may or may not present a time

   4   problem.  I can't say.

   5            We're still working on the last major piece, which is

   6   a stipulation concerning Somalia.  We hit some roadblocks.  We

   7   are hoping to have further discussions, I guess tomorrow, and

   8   hope to resolve that.  If we don't resolve that, there is the

   9   order of the Court relating to discovery material that the

  10   government is supposed to turn over.  We'll have to deal with

  11   that issue if we can't reach a stipulation.

  12            I don't know what to say to your Honor as to how long

  13   the government will take to turn over that material if they

  14   are required to.

  15            THE COURT:  All right.  Just one other unrelated

  16   matter --

  17            MR. SCHMIDT:  One other matter, your Honor.  There is

  18   apparently ex parte discussions that the government wants to

  19   have with your Honor concerning Sudan, which we'll want to

  20   deal with that next week as well.  We can do that in chambers

  21   ex parte one after the other, I guess, and make arrangements

  22   for that.

  23            THE COURT:  I just want to present one other thing

  24   which deals with the defense case on behalf of Odeh and the

  25   question of permissible cross-examination of Agent Gaudin, and


                  SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS (212) 805-0300
                                                                3563
       13tlbin2


   1   that's a matter which I want to address well in advance of

   2   that matter being before the jury.  And I'm sure that's in

   3   everyone's best interests, so that sometime next week I would

   4   like to take that issue up with counsel.

   5            You want to see me about some ex parte matter now?
