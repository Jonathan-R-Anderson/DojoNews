   5   Q.  Looking at Government Exhibit 1358 could you tell the jury

   6   what that is?

   7   A.  1358 is the gold razor that we found on the sink in room I

   8   within the house.

   9   Q.  1359, can you tell the jury what that is?

  10   A.  1359 is a bottle.  I'm not sure what the substance is, but

  11   we found it on the shelving to the left of the sink in Room I.

  12   Q.  Then I will approach with you 1363, 1370, 1371, 1373

  13   through 1378.  Starting with 1363, I think is the first item I

  14   gave you, can you tell us what that item is?

  15   A.  It looks like a concrete bag.

  16   Q.  Was that recovered in the search as well?

  17   A.  Yes, sir, it was.

  18   Q.  And as to these items did you prepare and work with others

  19   to prepare and review an evidence recovery log that would list

  20   all of the items that were recovered during the three days?

  21   A.  Yes, sir, throughout the search every item is logged on

  22   the recovery log as to where the item was found, and who

  23   recovered it, and there was on that log.

  24   Q.  Prior to coming to court today did you look at the various

  25   exhibits and verify that they were on the log?

  10   Q.  Will you look at 1373 through 1375, those three items

  11   next?

  12   A.  Yes, sir, 1373 is a newspaper.  1374 is a brown twine or

  13   string.  1375 is a grouping of wires, assorted sizes and

  14   shapes.  And 1378 looks like a vacuum sweeper.

  15   Q.  Will you check the number.  Is that 1378 or 77?

  16   A.  I'm sorry that was 77, excuse me.  1378 is a small piece

  17   of aluminum foil.
