<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  18   your report?

  19   A   I'd have to read the report, sir, and look.  But I recall

  20   from the 302 that there were phrases -- for instance, "like

  21   any true believing Muslim," that's not something that I would

  22   have wrote myself.  I believe those to be his exact words.

  23   Q   So the phrase "true believing Muslim" may be verbatim as

  24   to Mr. El Hage; is that correct?

  25   A   That's correct, sir.



                                                                3097



   1   Q   But the rest of the discussion as to American troops in

   2   Saudi Arabia is generally the substance but not a quote, isn't

   3   that right?

   4   A   That's probably correct, sir.

   5   Q   Mr. El Hage, in substance, said that he believed American

   6   policy towards Israel was unfair, isn't that right?

   7   A   That's correct, sir.

   8   Q   Now, let's use the word "unfair."  Was that a verbatim

   9   word or your sense of what Mr. El Hage was saying?

  10   A   I don't recall whether that was his word or not.

  11   Q   Well, when he said "the United States policy," was the

  12   word "policy" verbatim or the sense of what he was talking

  13   about?

  14   A   That was probably the sense of what he was talking about,

  15   sir.

  16   Q   During the time that he was talking about American policy,

  17   was that one answer or did you ask him some questions in

  18   between?

  19   A   As I recall, that was more of a conversation.  I'm sure

  20   that there were questions in between to have him elaborate on

  21   points.

  22   Q   And he was responsive to your questions concerning both

  23   his feelings towards American policy and what he believed that

  24   Mr. Bin Laden's feelings were towards American policy; is that

  25   right?



                                                                3098



   1   A   Yes, sir.

   2   Q   Is there any other word that you recall that struck you as

   3   either odd or so very important that, in the area of American

   4   foreign policy that you quoted verbatim?

   5   A   Are you talking about just the part about the foreign

   6   policy, sir?

   7   Q   That's correct.

   8   A   At this point, no, I don't recall that there was.

   9   Q   Did you think it was odd that Mr. El Hage thought that the

  10   U.S. policy towards Israel and the Palestinians were unfair?

  11   A   No.

  12   Q   Did you think it odd that Mr. El Hage believed that

  13   American troops should not be in the Saudi Peninsula, the land

  14   of the holy place?

  15   A   No.

  16   Q   Now, in fact, you said in your direct examination, after

  17   the discussion of American foreign policy, that, "During that
