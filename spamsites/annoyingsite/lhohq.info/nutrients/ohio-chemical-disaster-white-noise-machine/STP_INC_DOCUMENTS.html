<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">   9            MR. RUHNKE:  I just have one suggestion at the bottom

  10   of page 9.

  11            THE COURT:  Yes.

  12            MR. RUHNKE:  Actually, that last paragraph that

  13   begins "the last thing I wish to explain" is the only time

  14   that you tell the jury that they have to be unanimous in order

  15   to vote for a sentence of death, and I would ask that you, in

  16   the following sentence, beginning, "if the jury does not --"

  17            THE COURT:  Yes.

  18            MR. RUHNKE:  If the jury does not vote unanimously

  19   for a sentence of death, to reiterate that concept.

  20            THE COURT:  You think that one sentence is not

  21   sufficient?

  22            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, it's the only time you tell

  23   them that they have to be all in agreement to impose a

  24   sentence of death, which is really the crux.  The findings are

  25   not findings of statutory aggravating factors in this case or



                                                                6647



   1   non-statutory.  But based on my understanding of the facts in

   2   this case, they are not going to be much of a hurdle for the

   3   jury for some of them.  Some of those aggravating factors are

   4   subsumed within their guilt verdicts.  So I'm asking to

   5   emphasize if the jury does not vote unanimously for a sentence

   6   of death, it's saying the same thing twice back to back, but

   7   repetition is a form of emphasis.

   8            THE COURT:  In two sentences.

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  You are asking the bottom of page 9?

  10            MR. RUHNKE:  Page 9.

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Are we talking about just putting

  12   the word "unanimous " in that sentence?

  13            THE COURT:  Yes.

  14            MR. RUHNKE:  If the jury does not vote unanimously

  15   for a sentence of death, that's all.

  16            THE COURT:  Just repeating what they are told in the

  17   preceding sentence.  I don't feel strongly on that.

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I actually think that

  19   sentence could be removed, because it goes to the fact that

  20   the jury should, we hope, come to a unanimous decision to vote

  21   for a death sentence or for life imprisonment.  If we took it

  22   out, then the paragraph would end, "The last thing I would

  23   wish to explain," which would be the last thing, "is that all

  24   12 jurors must agree that death is the appropriate sentence,"

  25   and they make that point clear.



                                                                6648



   1            THE COURT:  How about that?  I just strike that

   2   sentence.

   3            MR. RUHNKE:  No, your honor, I don't want that

   4   sentence taken out as to what the consequences --

   5            THE COURT:  I don't think I have to repeat what is

   6   contained in the previous sentence.

   7            Anything else with respect to the preliminary

   8   instructions?  Anything else that --

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  I think your Honor was advised just

  10   of a typographical error on page 7 or 8.
