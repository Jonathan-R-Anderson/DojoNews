<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  22   you believe that a particular witness was motivated by hopes

  23   of personal gain, was the motivation one which would cause him

  24   to lie, or was it one which would cause him to tell the truth?

  25   Did this motivation color his testimony?




                                                                6060


   1            You should reject the testimony if you find it was

   2   false.  However, if, after a cautious and careful examination

   3   of the testimony and the witness's demeanor, you are satisfied

   4   that the testimony is true, you should accept it as credible

   5   and act on it accordingly.  As with any other witness, let me

   6   emphasize that the issue of credibility need not be decided on

   7   an all-or-nothing fashion.  Even if you find that a witness

   8   testified falsely on one part, you still may accept his or her

   9   testimony in other parts.  That is a determination entirely

  10   for you, the jury.

  11            In sum, you should look at all of the evidence in

  12   deciding what credence and what weight, if any, you should

  13   give to the testimony of an accomplice witness.

  14            On a related note, let me say a few words about the

  15   agreements between the government and certain of its witnesses

  16   other than alleged accomplices.  Some of these witnesses and

  17   their families have been placed in federal protective custody,

  18   and some have received money in connection with their

  19   protected custodial status.

  20       Again, you must examine the testimony of such a witness

  21   with caution.  Weigh it with great care.  If, after

  22   scrutinizing such testimony you decide to accept it, you may

  23   give it whatever weight, if any, you think it deserves.

  24            Some of the witnesses who testified for the

  25   government have pleaded guilty to charges arising out of




                                                                6061


   1   circumstances relating to the facts of this case.  You are

   2   instructed that you are to draw no conclusions or inferences

   3   of any kind about the guilt of the defendants on trial here

   4   from the fact that a prosecution witness pleaded guilty to

   5   similar charges.  The decision of that witness to plead guilty

   6   was based on a personal decision of his concerning his own

   7   guilt, and in light of the benefits afforded by the government

   8   to a cooperating witness.  In short, a witness's decision to

   9   plead guilty may not be used by you in any way as evidence

  10   against or unfavorable to the four defendants on trial here.

  11            During the course of this trial you have heard

  12   testimony from what the law calls expert witnesses --

  13   interjecting:  Handwriting, chemists, witnesses of that sort.
