   1            (In open court)

   2            THE COURT:  The jurors are all here.  I'm going to

   3   bring them in just to tell the jurors they can begin their

   4   deliberations and to excuse the alternates, with the same

   5   admonitions I gave them the last time.

   6            (Jury present)

   7            THE COURT:  Good morning.

   8            THE JURY:  Good morning.

   9            THE COURT:  Glad to see you all.  Hope you are all

  10   feeling well.  And the first order of business is the swearing

  11   of the marshal.

  12            Mr. Kenneally, will you swear the marshal.

  13            (Marshal sworn)

  14            THE COURT:  And ladies and gentlemen, you may return

  15   to the jury room and you may begin your deliberations.  And

  16   will the three alternates please remain in the courtroom.

  17            (The jury retires to deliberate upon a verdict at

  18   9:42 a.m.)

  19            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, my instructions to

  20   you this time are the same as the last, and that is that you

  21   are to continue to regard yourselves as being members of this

  22   jury.  You should not read, watch, listen to or anything about

  23   this case, and that you keep advised -- I assume the marshal

  24   has your telephone number, and we will let you know when the

  25   jury reaches a verdict so that you know that you are being



                                                                8745



   1   discharged.  And until that time, why, you are on-call if the

   2   need should arise.  And you are excused for the day and thank

   3   you very much for coming.

   4            ALTERNATE JURORS:  Thank you.

   5            (Alternates excused)

   6            THE COURT:  Anything?

   7            MR. RUHNKE:  No, your Honor.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  No, Judge.

   9            THE COURT:  We'll await word from the jury.  If they

  10   follow a pattern, we should get a note fairly soon with a

  11   request for whatever it is they may want to see.

  12            One lawyer for each side to remain in the courtroom.

  13            (Recess pending verdict)
