   1            THE COURT:  How are we going to know whether we sent

   2   in Exhibit 310?

   3            MR. KARAS:  Someone is checking upstairs, your Honor.

   4   We should be able to know very shortly.

   5            Your Honor, our records upstairs did not have the

   6   original 310, so we did send it in.

   7            THE COURT:  That is GX310-74A.

   8            MR. KARAS:  I think we sent in both 310-74A and the

   9   translation as well, 74A-T.

  10            THE COURT:  My note to the jury says:  "Ladies and

  11   gentlemen, the exhibits you requested will be given to you

  12   tomorrow morning.  Our records reflect that Government's

  13   Exhibit 310-74A and the translation Exhibit GX310-74A-T have

  14   previously been sent to you.  Have a good evening."

  15            I am handed a note which tells me that arrangements

  16   have been made by the marshal for the jurors for tomorrow

  17   morning and that we should be able to begin at 10:00 a.m.

  18   tomorrow.

  19            When the jury indicates that it wants to go home, we

  20   will adjourn.

  21            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, are you giving them an

  22   instruction somehow to continue not to read the papers, etc.?

  23            THE COURT:  Each time, no.

  24            MR. COHN:  I know they are not being brought in to be

  25   dismissed.  Could you reinforce that from time to time



                                                                6260



   1   somehow?  I don't care if it is done outside my presence if

   2   the court wants to do it.

   3            THE COURT:  Has the note been sent in?  Where is that

   4   note?  I will add it to that note.

   5            MR. COHN:  Just as an extra precaution.

   6            THE COURT:  You want me to reinforce my instruction

   7   not to read anything with respect to the McVeigh case?

   8            MR. HERMAN:  Withdrawn.

   9            MR. COHN:  This case, Judge.

  10            THE COURT:  Please adhere to my previous

  11   instructions.

  12            MR. COHN:  Don't read anything about FBI --

  13            THE COURT:  "P.S.  Please continue to adhere to my

  14   previous instructions to avoid reading, listening to or

  15   watching anything concerning this case or related matters."

  16            Very well.  Subject to all of that we are adjourned

  17   until --

  18            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, when do you want the

  19   exhibits?  At 10 or earlier?

  20            THE COURT:  Why don't you assemble them at 9:30 and

  21   we will send them in at 10, depending on when they actually

  22   start.

  23            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, are we being discharged now or

  24   are we waiting --

  25            THE COURT:  We are awaiting because between now and
