  23   yourself?

  24   A.  Yes, I got copy for it.

  25   Q.  Would you tell us who the president of the Sudan was.



                                                                234

  16            THE COURT:  Is this being offered for the truth of

  17   the contents of the letter or is this being offered for this

  18   witness's understanding and his state of mind?
