<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  17   true.  It also helps to set the timing.  We are not trying to

  18   argue to the jury because Mr. El Hage bought a dog he's a

  19   dangerous person.

  20            THE COURT:  Is there any suggestion that the dog was

  21   an attack dog?

  22            MR. FITZGERALD:  No, Judge.  There were dogs that

  23   were sent, other dogs that would be sent to Khartoum to be

  24   trained.  They weren't bought as trained attack dogs.  We

  25   won't contend that.  No one is going to argue that Mr. El Hage



                                                                4176



   1   is a dangerous person because he possessed a dog and I don't

   2   think putting a picture of a girl next to a dog in there is

   3   necessary to rebut any argument not being made.

   4            THE COURT:  What probative value does this have?

   5   It's a cute picture.  The jury certainly has not seen cute

   6   pictures, but --

   7            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, it simply is for the

   8   purpose of showing that the contact between Mr. El Hage and

   9   Mr. Bin Laden concerning the dogs was not sinister, was not

  10   criminal, it was not related to viciousness.  This is his pet.

  11            THE COURT:  Do you know the age of the dog?

  12            MR. SCHMIDT:  Excuse me?

  13            THE COURT:  Do you know the age of this dog?  Do you

  14   know how large this dog would be?  Do we know the height of

  15   the child?  Do we know anything about the dog?

  16            The objection is sustained on the grounds that the

  17   photograph has no probative value with respect to the issues

  18   for which it is proposed, and it's simply a cute picture of a

  19   child and a dog.  The impact on the jury would not be proper

  20   or relevant to the issues here which you propose.  Mark this

  21   as an exhibit for identification so that the record will make

  22   this colloquy more meaningful.

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, does that mean that we will

  24   be able to bring a redacted photo of this with just the dog?

  25            THE COURT:  No, for the same reason I just stated.



                                                                4177



   1   Let's bring in the jury, please.
