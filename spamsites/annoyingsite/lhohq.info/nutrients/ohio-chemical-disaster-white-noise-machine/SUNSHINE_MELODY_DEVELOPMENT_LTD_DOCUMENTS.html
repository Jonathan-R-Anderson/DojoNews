   7            MR. GARCIA:  If I neglected to, your Honor, at this

   8   time I would offer Government Exhibit 4303, which is the

   9   actual jacket.

  10            THE COURT:  4303?

  11            MR. GARCIA:  4303 is the item.

  12            THE COURT:  Has been received.

  13            MR. GARCIA:  Thank you, Judge.

  14            THE COURT:  They are all received.

  15   Q.  Lieutenant, are you familiar with the physical layout of

  16   10 South?

  17   A.  Yes, I am.

  18   Q.  And as part of your duties, do you do an inspection of

  19   that floor from time to time?

  20   A.  Yes, I do.

  21            MR. GARCIA:  If we could show the witness Government

  22   Exhibit 4037.

  23   Q.  Do you recognize the scene depicted in this photograph?

  24   A.  Yes, I do.

  25   Q.  What is --




                                                                7762


   1   A.  I'm sorry?

   2   Q.  What is it?

   3   A.  That's an electrical box that's up on the ceiling.  That's

   4   right by the storage closet in Cell 6.

   5            MR. GARCIA:  I offer 4037.

   6            MR. STERN:  No objection.

   7            THE COURT:  Received.

   8            (Government Exhibit 4037 received in evidence)

   9   BY MR. GARCIA:

  10   Q.  Now that the jury has this, Lieutenant, could you describe

  11   it again for us here?

  12   A.  What that is is an electrical box with all the electrical

  13   wires going through it.  I couldn't tell you exactly what was

  14   going through that.  That's located up on the ceiling between

  15   right by Cell 6 and then that would be, if you are coming

  16   toward that would be on the left-hand side and on the

  17   right-hand side is the electrical and the storage closet.

  18   Q.  And is this how this box appeared after the incident on 10

  19   South on the morning of November 1?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And is it different than it would usually appear?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  Could you describe the difference for us?

  24   A.  It wouldn't be bent down like that or hanging.  It would

  25   be just flush, a piece of metal flush, bolted in there.  You




                                                                7763


   1   see there's one screw missing or more, and there would be all

   2   the screws in there.

   3   Q.  And this metal plate on the bottom in the center -- if we

   4   could enlarge that a little bit, perhaps -- bent down in that

   5   way on the center?

   6   A.  It would not.

   7   Q.  And you mention that from time to time you do inspections

   8   of the 10 South floor?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Would you be looking at the ceiling area?

  11   A.  Yes, I would.  I look up, down, look at the walls, I look

  12   at the cells.

  13   Q.  Did you do such an inspection on the morning of November

  14   1?

  15   A.  Yes, I did.

  16   Q.  And did you see this box in this condition?

  17   A.  No, I did not.

  18            MR. GARCIA:  If we could have Government Exhibit 4000

  19   put up for a moment.

  20   Q.  If you could just indicate for us generally on Government

  21   Exhibit 4000 where that junction box is?

  22   A.  It would be right in the ceiling, right where it says

  23   "TEL" and "electric."  I know that's the storage closet, but

  24   it would be right over there.

  25            MR. GARCIA:  If we could enlarge that area, if




                                                                7764


   1   possible.

   2   A.  It would be up in the ceiling on that area.

   3   Q.  In the hallway area?

   4   A.  Yes, in the hallway area.

   5   Q.  Approximately between where it says T-E-L and what's

   6   labeled "lab library"; is that correct?

   7   A.  Yes, lab library.

   8            MR. GARCIA:  I have nothing further, Judge.

   9   CROSS-EXAMINATION

  10   BY MR. STERN:

  11   Q.  Lt. Carrino, you said you were responsible for the SHU

  12   unit, is that right?

  13   A.  Yes, it is.
