  14     a bombing, he is worth maybe more.  Maybe he

  15     assaults an officer and tries to take a hostage

  16     and still serves a life sentence, maybe he is

  17     worth more.

  18               I submit punishing someone with life

  19     imprisonment or death, no one is going to give

  20     anyone credit.  No terrorist attack is going to

  21     be stopped because someone gets a life sentence

  22     versus death.  Usama Bin Laden hates us.  There

  23     is no way around it.  Everyone in his group

  24     hates us.  They hate everything we do,

  25     everything we try to do, everything we don't

   2     do.  This trial, in their eyes, is a fraud.

   3     Everything we do is a fraud.  We are evil.  Do

   4     you really think this is an operation that is

   5     going to be wiped off the books if Khalfan

   6     Mohamed gets a life sentence?  I submit to you

   7     not.

   8               Look at this case.  The claims of

   9     responsibility for the bombing he did in

  10     Tanzania is in the name of Salmon al Odeh and

  11     Zafra Al-'Owhali.  Not related to Al-'Owhali,

  12     not related to Odeh, two scholars in a Saudi

  13     prison.  Look at the stipulation.  Sheik Omar

  14     was convicted for trying to murder President

  15     Mubarak of Egypt because of the arrest of

  16     Mahmud Abouhalima.  Bin Laden is screaming

  17     about Al-'Owhali because of his arrest.

  18               I submit to you, look at the note,

  19     look at the hostage-taking note left on

  20     November 1, 2000.  "Please release," fill in

  21     the blank, "from custody."  If you are in jail,

  22     they want you out.  And they are going to bomb,

  23     they are going to do what they want to do to

  24     get people out of jail.  If they decide to do a

  25     bombing and name it after people, they will

   3               But don't let Khalfan Mohamed try to

   4     get, a terrorist, gee, give me life, maybe it

   5     will be the last bombing.  It ain't happening.

   6     His name will be on the list of 50 others names

   7     when he is in jail or whether he is executed as

   8     a reason to go forward.

   9               K.  Khalfan Mohamed should not have

  10     been released by South African authorities.

  11     Mr. Ruhnke opened on the fact that this was

  12     almost like being struck by lightening.  And

  13     again, it's sort of passive stuff.  It's like

  14     the weather.  Khalfan Mohamed blowing in the

  15     wind, struck by lightening to face the death

  16     penalty.

  17               Let's step back and think about it.

  18     It is not lightening.  Okay, the law of our

  19     country, the law of our nation is if you commit

  20     murder, certain murders, you face the death

  21     penalty.  Khalfan Mohamed committed murder 11

  22     times over.  If he faces the death penalty,

  23     it's not because he got struck by lightening,

  24     but because he killed.  He made a choice and he

  25     killed and he'll get a punishment provided by

   3               He killed in Tanzania, where there is

   4     a death penalty.  He killed Tanzanians.  He

   5     killed trying to kill Americans, and the death

   6     penalty is here.  He killed Muslims, as the

   7     imam told you in that video.  Islam makes no

   8     apologies for the death penalty.  He killed in

   9     a country with a death penalty, against a

  10     country with a death penalty, and people of a

  11     religion who have the death penalty.

  12               And then he went to South Africa,

  13     went to South Africa, which happened not to

  14     have the death penalty.  He went to South
