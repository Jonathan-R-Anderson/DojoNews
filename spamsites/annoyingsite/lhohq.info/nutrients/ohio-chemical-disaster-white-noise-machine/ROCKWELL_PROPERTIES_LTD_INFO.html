   2               It's something none of the people

   3     around him understood.  When you heard from his

   4     family, they never would have thought he would

   5     have engaged in violence.  When you heard from

   6     the imam in South Africa, he never thought that

   7     Khalfan would engage in violence.  When you

   8     heard from the Dalvies, they thought he

   9     wouldn't hurt an ant.  That's because Khalfan

  10     has a side to him, a cold-blooded killing side

  11     that he kills, remorseless, by choice, and

  12     doesn't show it to people.  That's not a

  13     cultural thing.  That's an evil character trait

  14     of the defendant.  That's what killed those

  15     people on August 7th.  That's what happened on

  16     November 1st, 2000.

  17               And let's not try to hide behind

  18     culture or religion.  Many, many people grew up

  19     in Tanzania with a lot less.  Many people grew

  20     up in America with a lot less.  He had a loving

  21     family.  There is no abuse.  That family didn't

  22     have violence in it or drugs or alcohol abuse

  23     or other stuff.  A lot of people grow up with

  24     rough lives a lot closer to this courthouse

  25     than Tanzania.  He had a loving family and he

   2     made a cold choice.  He decided to do what he

   3     did and kill people and have no remorse.

   4               Government Exhibit 3022, Mohamed

   5     Jelani Mohamed, a man who helped his family,

   6     who helped his village, with a wife, who had

   7     children from a prior marriage that he tried to

   8     see but obviously will never see again.

   9     Khalfan Mohamed killed him, too.

  10               And Doto Rahadhani, Government

  11     Exhibit 3032.  Remember Doto.  Doto, his twin

  12     Kulwa testified.  The two of them played

  13     together.  They actually played on a soccer

  14     team together, but they had a rough life.

  15     Their mother and father both died.  They were

  16     left with four brothers and sisters, and it was

  17     Doto who was the family breadwinner.

  18               In fact, it's not coincidence that

  19     all the people killed were the family

  20     breadwinners.  A job in the embassy is a good

  21     job.  The people who work there were the

  22     mainstays of their families and their

  23     communities.  They could earn money to help

  24     others.

  25               And Doto was raising his family,

   2     raising his brothers and sisters, raising his

   3     twin brother.  He had a fiance, Martha.  They

   4     were going to be married in September of 1998.

   5     If Khalfan Mohamed hadn't killed him, hadn't

   6     killed Doto a month before, he would be married

   7     and he would have his plan, his plan for two

   8     children.

   9               I submit to you that the victim

  10     impact in this case, we cannot get numb to it.

  11     We cannot get numb to it because of all the

  12     death we have heard.  We cannot be numbed to it

  13     because people speak a different language, are

  14     soft-spoken, from a different country.  They

  15     were good, decent, hard-working, law-abiding

  16     people who were slaughtered.  Khalfan doesn't

  17     care, but we all should.  I submit to you that

  18     the victim impact in this case, the magnitude

  19     of the crime, what he did to people is a

  20     sufficient reason to vote for the death

  21     penalty.

  22               And you may ask yourself, well, you

  23     know what, all those people are dead.  Voting

  24     for the death penalty doesn't bring anyone

  25     back.  What does it do?  I submit to you we

   2     have to start thinking, we can't stop looking

   3     at Khalfan saying, what can we do for him?  We

   4     can't think of the victims as water under the

   5     bridge, because that's what Khalfan wants them

   6     to be.  Khalfan, the whole point to the

   7     bombing, the whole point to the bombing is to

   8     terrify people, slaughter them, bomb them, kill

   9     them.

  10               Omari Nyumbu's daughter doesn't go to

  11     school.  She doesn't eat.  What Khalfan did
