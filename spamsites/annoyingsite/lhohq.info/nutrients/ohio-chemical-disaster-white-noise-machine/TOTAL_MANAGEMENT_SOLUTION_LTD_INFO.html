  12   particular association the Court was instructing them to deal

  13   with.

  14            THE COURT:  Denied.

  15            MR. WILFORD:  All right.  Also, in that same section,

  16   your Honor, and this is overall to most of the remaining

  17   counts in which the Court instructs on Five and Six, as an

  18   example, 283 and 284, the Court instructs the jury to

  19   consider -- not on this particular page, your Honor, but this

  20   particular section of the charge, when you are talking about

  21   Counts Five and Six, which begins on page 72, and you talk in

  22   that instance, you talk about Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed

  23   Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali, and also in Count Six, Khalfan Khamis

  24   Mohamed, because the elements are the same, the Court has

  25   grouped in a section both, all three of these particular



                                                                5193



   1   defendants.

   2            However, because of the difference in proof that has

   3   been adduced at trial, the fact that Mr. Odeh has nothing to

   4   do whatsoever with anything in Tanzania, I think that it adds

   5   some confusion for the jury and what we are requesting is that

   6   it be a separate section charging the Kenyan events as opposed

   7   to having them both together.  I understand, I think, what the

   8   Court was trying to do was to shorten and have the jury

   9   consider those groups of elements or that group of elements

  10   for those particular crimes, but what it does do --

  11            THE COURT:  I understand what you are saying, but I

  12   think it sets out the legal principles, which are the same,

  13   and then it very clearly indicates which counts are Kenya and

  14   which counts are Tanzania, looking at the first full paragraph

  15   on page 75, and any danger, I think, of that is dissipated by

  16   the structure of the special verdict form.

  17            What I usually do is I go back and forth.  When I

  18   complete a count, I will then say, "Now turn to the special

  19   verdict form and you will see..."  So I don't think that's

  20   worth regurgitating the same.

  21            MR. WILFORD:  Thank you, Judge.

  22            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, the only other comment

  23   the government had that's not tied to a particular page but we

  24   thought maybe might be appropriate around page 81 was to

  25   suggest the possibility of a conscious avoidance charge on the



                                                                5194



   1   substantive bombings, and the reason I suggest that is looking

   2   ahead specifically with regard to the Odeh case and the

   3   bombing, there was some discussion during the Wahhaj testimony

   4   about whether he inquired about what others were up to, but I

   5   could easily foresee the way the summations might play out

   6   that there may be an argument by the government that he can't

   7   be in the middle of things and, pardon the expression, but

   8   "stick his head in the sand."

   9            THE COURT:  Like an ostrich.  I was thinking about

  10   all our ostrich discussion, that we'll not be able to get

  11   through closing statements without somebody making the analogy

  12   to ostriches.
