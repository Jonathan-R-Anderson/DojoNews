  11            MR. HERMAN:  Thank you.  You can take that off the

  12   screen.

  13   Q.  Incidentally, when you were going through the home, I

  14   gather there was no telephone or anything like that in the

  15   home.

  16   A.  No, I did not see a telephone in the home.

  17   Q.  You had your own communication devices that you were using

  18   if necessary?

  19   A.  No.

  20   Q.  You had no connection to the rest of the world when you

  21   were in Witu?

  22   A.  We would use public telephone or make arrangements through

  23   the Kenyan CID if we needed to.

  24   Q.  Was there a public phone, if you recall, in town?

  25   A.  In town?  I didn't specifically look for one, so I



                                                                1845



   1   couldn't say.

   2   Q.  Did you notice a post office or anything that would be

   3   involved with postal delivery, mail delivery, anything to that

   4   effect?

   5   A.  I don't recall whether there was or not.

   6   Q.  When you were doing your search and collecting the items

   7   that you have indicated, were all of them readily available to

   8   you in that you didn't have to break into a safe or break into

   9   a closet, anything of that nature?

  10   A.  While they weren't all in plain view, there was nothing

  11   that we had to force open.

  12   Q.  So they were easily accessible to you when you gathered

  13   them?

  14   A.  Yes, once we went looking, yes.

  15   Q.  These items that you collected were turned over to

  16   American officials; is that your understanding?

  17   A.  When I returned to Nairobi, I turned them over to another

  18   American who was responsible for maintaining custody.
