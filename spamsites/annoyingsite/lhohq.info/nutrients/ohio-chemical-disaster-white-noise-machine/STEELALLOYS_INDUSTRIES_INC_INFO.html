   6   Mohamed.


   7            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, I would quarrel with the

   8   government's description of the upcoming victim impact

   9   evidence in the K.K. Mohamed penalty phase as it is of the

  10   same nature as has been presented here.  Fortunately, there

  11   were no injuries that even remotely approached the seriousness

  12   of the injuries that occurred in Nairobi.

  13            THE COURT:  People died, right?

  14            MR. RUHNKE:  People died, your Honor, yes.

  15            THE COURT:  And the difference, the quantity is less,

  16   fewer people died?

  17            MR. RUHNKE:  Yes, and fewer people were injured and

  18   the injuries were --

  19            THE COURT:  But the people who were killed and the

  20   families of people killed and the impact on the persons who

  21   were injured in Tanzania is comparable.

  22            MR. RUHNKE:  I agree.  I agree that there will be

  23   victim impact evidence.  I don't agree that it is going to be

  24   comparable, certainly not in the number of witnesses,

  25   certainly not in the kind of injuries.



                                                                7282



   1            THE COURT:  Other than volume, how is it not going to

   2   be comparable?

   3            MR. RUHNKE:  The nature of injuries of people who

   4   were injured.  There are no people who are blind.  There are

   5   no people in wheelchairs.

   6            THE COURT:  How many people were killed?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Eleven.

   8            THE COURT:  Eleven people.

   9            Anything else you want to tell me?

  10            MR. RUHNKE:  No, your Honor.

  11            THE COURT:  There are a number of factors here.

  12   First of all, the jury selection process in this case was very

  13   painstaking.  It involved 1100 questionnaires being

  14   distributed, 2 weeks of individual voir dire.  It produced a

  15   jury which, as I have already commented, by gender,

  16   socioeconomic status and ethnicity, is a remarkable cross

  17   section of the community.

  18            This jury has demonstrated that it is not discharging

  19   its task as a matter of reflexive response, but has

  20   painstakingly reviewed the evidence as to guilt.  The two

  21   questions we have already received from the jury with respect

  22   to the Al-'Owhali penalty phase would seem to suggest that it

  23   will approach its task here as conscientiously and

  24   deliberatively as it did in the guilt phase, and as one would

  25   hope that it would do here.



                                                                7283



   1            To discharge this jury would not only require the

   2   additional time, effort of selecting a new jury, but would

   3   require the presentation to a newly impaneled jury of all that

   4   the present jury has already learned.  Indeed, insofar as

   5   victim impact is concerned, the government indicates that it

   6   plans to call, as it has a right to do, witnesses with respect


   7   to the victim impact of the Tanzania bombing.

   8            The fact that 11 people were killed rather than over

   9   200 is something which this jury will know, and the

  10   significance of that numerical disparity is something which

  11   can be argued to the jury.

  12            The motion is denied.  Thank you.

  13            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, may Mr. Baugh and I see you in

  14   an ex parte conversation?  Your Honor will then make a

  15   judgment as to whether or not to disclose it to the

  16   government.  Something that's come up that has nothing to do

  17   with anything that you heard in the courtroom.  I just think

  18   it's appropriate to put it on the record.

  19            THE COURT:  You want something put --

  20            MR. COHN:  On the record.

  21            THE COURT:  On the record, but ex parte.

  22            All right.  Is Mr. Baugh here?

  23            MR. BAUGH:  Yes, sir.
