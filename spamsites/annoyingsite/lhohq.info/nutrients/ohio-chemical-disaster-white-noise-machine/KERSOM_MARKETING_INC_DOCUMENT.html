  15   A.  Good morning to you.

  16   Q.  During the search that took place you kept contemporaneous

  17   notes of events that were going on.  Isn't that right?

  18   A.  That's correct, yes, sir.

  19   Q.  And the reason why you keep your notes contemporaneous is

   2   that are happening almost every ten minutes, isn't that right?

   3   A.  I recall them as adds when I can, immediately.  I don't

   4   wait ten minutes.

   5   Q.  Because with the passage of time things change and you

   6   forget to put it down, isn't that right?

   7   A.  No, sir.
