   5   Q   How are you presently employed?

   6   A   I'm a special agent with the Federal Bureau of

   7   Investigation.

   8   Q   And how long have you been with the FBI?

   9   A   Approximately 23 years.

  10   Q   And drawing your attention to August 27th, 1998, were you

  11   on duty that day?

  12   A   Yes, I was.

  13   Q   What was your assignment?

  14   A   I was involved in the rendition of Mohamed Odeh from

  15   Nairobi, Kenya to New York.

  16   Q   Was it your understanding that Mr. Odeh was under arrest

  17   by United States authorities when he was taken on the plane?

  18   A   Yes.

  19   Q   Was that arrest related to the charges in this case?

  20   A   Yes.

  21   Q   Where did the plane first land in the United States?

  22   A   Stewart Air Force Base, New York.

  23            MR. BUTLER:  No further questions.

  24            THE COURT:  Anything?

  25            MR. RICCO:  Yes, your Honor.



                                                                3836



   1   CROSS-EXAMINATION

   2   BY MR. RICCO:

   3   Q   Good morning, Agent Foley.

   4   A   Good morning.

   5   Q   When you look back to the day when you took Mr. Odeh into

   6   custody in Kenya, when Mr. Odeh was on the airplane, he was

   7   handcuffed to the chair, isn't that right?

   8   A   For most of the time, yes.

   9   Q   And at the time he was handcuffed to the chair, he was

  10   dressed in a black jumpsuit; isn't that correct?

  11   A   Yes, I believe that is correct.

  12   Q   Just before he boarded the plane, the FBI removed from him

  13   the clothing that he was wearing; isn't that correct?

  14   A   To the best of my knowledge -- I can't remember whether we

  15   put the black suit over the clothes he had on or removed it.

  16   Q   Okay.  So, therefore, you don't know whether or not the

  17   clothing that he had on, the civilian clothing, was sent on to

  18   a lab or not?

  19   A   No, I do not.

  20   Q   But you do have a recollection that while he was on that

  21   plane he was cuffed to a chair and he had a black jumpsuit on?

  22   A   That's correct.

  23   Q   Now, the plane, before it arrived in the United States,

  24   that plane landed in Cairo; isn't that correct?

  25            MR. BUTLER:  Objection, your Honor.



                                                                3837



   1            THE COURT:  Overruled.

   2            You may answer.

   3   A   Yes.

   4   Q   Okay.  Also, during the flight Mr. Odeh was read Miranda

   5   warnings and may have been asked one or two questions; isn't

   6   that correct?

   7            MR. BUTLER:  Objection, your Honor.

   8            THE COURT:  That's sustained.

   9   Q   Okay.  There's no question in your mind that at the time

  10   Mr. Odeh was placed on that plane in Kenya he was under

  11   arrest, isn't that right?

  12   A   Under arrest in Kenya?

  13   Q   Yes.

  14   A   Yes, we handcuffed him there, so he was taken into

  15   custody.

  16            MR. RICCO:  Thank you.  I have no further questions,

  17   your Honor.

  18            THE COURT:  Anything further of this witness?

  19            Thank you, Agent.  You may step down.

  20            (Witness excused)

  21            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, the government recalls

  22   Abigail Seda.

  23    ABIGAIL SEDA, recalled

  24            THE COURT:  Ms. Seda, the Court reminds you you are

  25   still under oath.



                                                                3838



   1   DIRECT EXAMINATION

   2   BY MR. KARAS:

   3   Q   Good morning, Ms. Seda.

   4   A   Good morning.

   5            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, may I approach the witness?

   6            THE COURT:  Yes.

   7   Q   Ms. Seda, I have placed before you what's been marked for

   8   identification as Government Exhibit 660.  Can you tell us

   9   what that is?

  10   A   It's a summary chart of calls from number 2542820067 to
