   9   the preceding paragraph, and the government and the defense

  10   reserve the right to object to the admissibility of any

  11   particular item or the translation of same as each is offered.

  12   It is the purpose of this stipulation to avoid the necessity

  13   of calling and recalling multiple authentication witnesses at

  14   trial during the government and defense cases regarding the

  15   translations.  The parties stipulate that if called as a

  16   witness, a person fluent in Arabic and English would testify

  17   that the translations listed above are fair and accurate

  18   translations.

  19            4.  It is further stipulated and agreed that this

  20   stipulation may be received in evidence as a defense exhibit

  21   at trial.

  22            Your Honor, I would move the underlying documents

  23   listed in the stipulation in evidence.

  24            THE COURT:  Received.

  25            MR. DRATEL:  Thank you, your Honor.  The stipulation



                                                                5136



   1   is WEHXS11.

   2            THE COURT:  Received.

   3            (Defense Exhibits WEHXS11 and exhibits described

   4   therein received in evidence)

   5            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, other than what we briefly

   6   mentioned, defendant rests.

   7            THE COURT:  Defendant El Hage rests?

   8            MR. SCHMIDT:  That is correct.

   9            THE COURT:  That is with the exception of a

  10   stipulation, Mr. Schmidt, which is in the process.

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  That was actually executed, Judge.

  12            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.

  13            THE COURT:  I think it was just executed and read.

  14            MR. DRATEL:  Yes, we just did that one.  Mr. Schmidt

  15   was unaware.

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I think there is one

  17   possible outstanding one.

  18            THE COURT:  A stipulation which has already been

  19   discussed with the government?

  20            MR. SCHMIDT:  It has been discussed but not

  21   concluded.

  22            THE COURT:  But no live testimony?

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  No additional live witnesses, that is

  24   correct.

  25            THE COURT:  Very well.  Mr. Cohn.



                                                                5137



   1            MR. COHN:  Thank you, your Honor.  Your Honor, I have

   2   one, just one stipulation.  It is hereby stipulated and agreed

   3   by and between defendant Al-'Owhali, by and with the consent

   4   of his attorney and the United States of America by Mary Jo

   5   White, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New

   6   York, Patrick Fitzgerald, Kenneth M. Karas, Paul W. Butler and

   7   Michael J. Garcia, of counsel, that:

   8            1.  Government's Exhibit 562 -- may we have that,

   9   flip the switch for us, please?  Thank you -- that

  10   Government's Exhibit 562 is the newspaper photograph which the

  11   witness Charles Mwaka Mula stated in August 1998 that he

  12   recognized as depicting the person that he saw emerge from the

  13   passenger side of the truck and begin throwing items the day

  14   of the embassy bombings.

  15            Further, it is stipulated that Government's Exhibit

  16   563 is the composite sketch prepared by an FBI agent based on

  17   the description provided by the witness Charles Mwaka Mula on

  18   August 11, 1998, of the individual he observed exiting the

  19   truck and throwing items on the day of the bombing.

  20            It is further stipulated and agreed that Government's

  21   Exhibits 562 and 560 may be received in evidence at trial --

  22   and, your Honor, I believe they already are in evidence.

  23            It is further stipulated and agreed that this

  24   stipulation may be received as evidence at trial, and this

  25   stipulation is marked Al-'Owhali L.



                                                                5138



   1            THE COURT:  Received.
