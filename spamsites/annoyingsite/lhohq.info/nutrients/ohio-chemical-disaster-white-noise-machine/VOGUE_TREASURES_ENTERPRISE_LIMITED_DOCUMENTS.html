  10   charges that on or about August 7, 1998, in Nairobi, Kenya,

  11   and outside the jurisdiction of any particular state or

  12   district, ... defendants Odeh and Al-'Owhali -- skipping the

  13   jurisdictional language which we'll talk about later -- and

  14   others known and unknown, unlawfully, willfully, knowingly,

  15   deliberately, and maliciously, and with malice aforethought

  16   and with premeditation, did murder representatives, officers,

  17   employees and agents of the United States Government, who at

  18   the time and place concerned were entitled pursuant to

  19   international law to special protection against attack upon

  20   their persons, freedom and dignity.

  21            The statute in question provides "[w]hoever

  22   kills ... [an] internationally protected person" is guilty of

  23   a crime.  As I have previously explained, an "internationally

  24   protected person" is defined to include a "representative,

  25   officer, employee, or agent of the United States Government



                                                                6177



   1   ... who at the time and place concerned is entitled pursuant

   2   to international law to special protection against attack upon

   3   his person, freedom or dignity."

   4            In these counts, the government further alleges that

   5   the defendants committed the killings with malice aforethought

   6   and with premeditation.

   7            To satisfy its burden of proof as to Counts 278 and

   8   279 with respect to the defendant you are considering, the

   9   government must prove each of the following elements beyond a

  10   reasonable doubt:

  11            First, that the defendant killed, or aided and

  12   abetted the killing of, the victim as charged;

  13            Second, that the victim was a representative,

  14   officer, employee, or agent of the United States Government
