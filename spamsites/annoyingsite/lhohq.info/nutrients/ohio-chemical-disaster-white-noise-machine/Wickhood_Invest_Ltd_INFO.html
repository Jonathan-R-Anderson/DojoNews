   1            (In open court)

   2            THE COURT:  Good morning.

   3            The jury arrived at 9:15 this morning and the

   4   exhibits that they requested yesterday, which have been

   5   reviewed by counsel, were sent in at that time.

   6            The Court received by hand delivery this morning a

   7   letter dated June 6th from Mr. Ruhnke, moving on behalf of

   8   Khalfan Khamis Mohamed that the present jury be discharged at

   9   the conclusion of its penalty phase deliberations, and that a

  10   new jury be selected to hear the penalty proceedings regarding

  11   Khalfan Khamis Mohamed.

  12            Mr. Ruhnke, this motion is made prior to any verdict

  13   by this jury, and I take it this is independent of any verdict

  14   by this jury.

  15            MR. RUHNKE:  That's right.  The timing was, in

  16   essence, deliberate, and we understand that --

  17            THE COURT:  So that if this jury determines that the

  18   death penalty should not be imposed, you would still have this

  19   jury discharged?

  20            MR. RUHNKE:  Yes, your Honor.

  21            THE COURT:  And is there anything you want to add to

  22   your letter?

  23            MR. RUHNKE:  The only thing I would add is this.

  24   Someone reading this letter this morning said, "Is this

  25   further evidence of making the observation that no good deed



                                                                7275



   1   goes unpunished?" in the sense that your Honor had ordered

   2   separate penalty phases on my urging and that of co-counsel.

   3            As I stated in the letter, however, given the

   4   powerful nature of the victim impact evidence in this case

   5   that the jury has heard, had we had a joint penalty trial, we


   6   would have moved for a severance at that point on the theory
