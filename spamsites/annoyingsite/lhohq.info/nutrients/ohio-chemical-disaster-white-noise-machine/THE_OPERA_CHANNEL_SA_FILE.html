   9   told you about jihad after the prayer during that meeting.

  10   A.  He talk about the Soviet Union army come to Afghanistan

  11   and kill people and we have to help them, we have to make

  12   jihad out of them and you have to be patient, you have to

  13   follow the rule of the emir.

  14   Q.  And do you recall anything in particular that Abu Hajer al

  15   Iraqi said that day during the meeting after the prayer?

  16   A.  He say similar what Bin Laden talk about, but he make

  17   lecture for all new people about Jihad Fardh al Ein.

  18   Q.  You mentioned a term Jihad Fardh al Ein, and why don't we

  19   spell:  F-A-R-D-H, separate word A-L, separate word E-I-N.

  20            And why don't you explain as best you can to the jury

  21   what the concept of Jihad Fardh al Ein is.

  22   A.  Jihad --

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor, as to what he

  24   says it is or what he believes it is.

  25            THE COURT:  What he understood it to be, this



                                                                178



   1   witness's understanding of that term.

   2   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

   3   Q.  Can you explain your understanding of what Jihad Fardh al

   4   Ein is?

   5   A.  Jihad Fardh al Ein mean when the enemy come to Muslim war

   6   or Muslim country and the people live in that country, they

   7   cannot push the enemy back and they ask for other brother or

   8   other Muslim to come and join them.  That means any Muslim in

   9   the war, he should go over there and push the enemy out of the

  10   country.

  11   Q.  And during the time when there's a Jihad Fardh al Ein, if

  12   a person is busy in personal matters with their family, with

  13   school, are they allowed not to go to the Jihad Fardh al Ein?

  14   A.  If it's Jihad Fardh al Ein means your family, your kids,

  15   your money, your business, you have to forget everything, just

  16   focus on jihad.

  17   Q.  And is there a time of Jihad where it's optional if you

  18   actually go to do the fighting?  Do you have a choice other

  19   than jihad, something different than Jihad Fardh al Ein, where

  20   a person has the option not to go and fight but instead to

  21   take care of their other business?

  22   A.  Yeah, we have another kind, it's called Jihad Fardh al

  23   Khafiya.

  24   Q.  I'll try and display that spelling on the screen.

  25            If you could look at the screen in a moment and tell



                                                                179



   1   me if the words displayed are Jihad Fardh al Khafiya?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  During this meeting with Usama Bin Laden and Abu Hajer al

   4   Iraqi at this meeting, did you learn of Usama Bin Laden being

   5   referred to by any other name besides Abu Abdallah?

   6   A.  Yeah, he got another nickname, it's called Al Qaqa.

   7   Q.  Al Qaqa?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  During that meeting what name were you referred to by?

  10   A.  Abu Bakr Sudani.

  11   Q.  During the time that you were in Afghanistan, did you meet

  12   a lot of people by their Abu names?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  Did you always know what their true name was?

  15   A.  No.

  16   Q.  Are there people to this day that you know by an Abu name

  17   for whom you do not know their true name?

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor.  Objection as to

  19   the form of the question.
