  15   Q.  To the best of your recollection, who was it that grabbed

  17   A.  I believe it was Officer Jenkins because he was right in

  18   front of me.

  19   Q.  He was in front of you; you were behind?

   1   Mohamed was trying to squirt us with something.

   2   Q.  When you say he was trying to squirt you, could you tell

   3   us on the diagram where Inmate Mohamed was when you first saw

   4   him?

   5   A.  He was in Cell 6.  He was right by the, in the back part

   6   of that corner where the electrical room is by the telephone,

   7   over in that area in the far right-hand corner, right where

   8   the icon is.

   9   Q.  Right where the arrow is now, where it says E-L-E-C-T on

  10   the diagram?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  You keep referring to Inmate Mohamed.  Were you familiar

  13   with Inmate Mohamed prior to that date?

  14   A.  Yes, I was.

  15   Q.  Looking around the courtroom today, do you see the person

  16   you knew as Inmate Mohamed?

  17   A.  Yes, I do.

  18   Q.  Could you point him out for us?

  19   A.  He's sitting right over there with the glasses on and the

  20   beard.

  21            MR. RUHNKE:  Conceded.

  22            THE COURT:  The witness has identified the defendant

  23   K.K. Mohamed.

  24   BY MR. GARCIA:

  25   Q.  Can you tell us now what was this defendant doing when you




                                                                7756


   1   first saw him in that corner by the electrical closet?

   2   A.  He was in that corner.  He was crouched, he was up against

   3   the corner of the wall, he was crouched down, and then he had

   4   something, like I said, in his hand.  As we were approaching

   5   toward him, he started squirting that substance at us.

   6   Q.  And did he hit you, as far as you know, with the substance

   7   from that bottle?

   8   A.  Yes, he did.  It was on my clothing, my jacket, my pants

   9   and my shirt.

  10   Q.  What did you do after he squirted you?

  11   A.  At that time, after he started squirting, he saw us

  12   approaching him.  He moved out of the corner a little bit more

  13   toward the middle of that wall where we went straight toward

  14   him with the shield, pushed him against the wall with the

  15   shield.  The shield shattered.

  16            At that point in time he was taken down to the

  17   ground.  I was on top of him.  A few other officers, we

  18   managed to get his right hand handcuffed.  He refused to give

  19   us his other hand.  He was laying on his stomach fighting,

  20   bucking back and forth.  I kept telling him, give me your

  21   hand.  Let go.  Give me your hand.  It was underneath his

  22   body.  He refused to give it.

  23            Finally, I pried it loose and brought it up to the

  24   middle of his back and Officer Jenkins took the other handcuff

  25   and handcuffed him.




                                                                7757


   1   Q.  During this time that this is happening on the floor of

   2   this area back by Cell 6, what other officers do you remember

   3   were with you trying to subdue this defendant?

   4   A.  The only other person I can remember is officer -- at that

   5   time Officer Maiden.  There was at that point in time a bunch

   6   more staff were there.  By names, I could not tell you who was

   7   down there.  I was not looking at faces.

   8   Q.  You also mentioned Officer Jenkins as trying to cuff him?

   9   A.  Yes.
