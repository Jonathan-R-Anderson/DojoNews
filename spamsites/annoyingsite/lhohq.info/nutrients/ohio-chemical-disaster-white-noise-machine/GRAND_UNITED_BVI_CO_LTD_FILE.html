  16     basically because we had found him where he was

  17     in Cape Town, that we already knew everything

  18     so there was no reason for him to tell us one

  19     thing when we knew that in fact another was

  20     true.  He said it because they knew it.  And he

  21     said it to say, I'm proud of the bombing, it

  22     was a success.

  23               It tied the investigators up because

  24     it took them 14 months to find him.  And he

  25     said he would do it again.  He gets no credit

   2     for being complete and truthful.  And you know

   3     what?  Five weeks ago he is over there telling

   4     Dr. Post, I deny the FBI report.  He wants

   5     credit for that?  Admit it because you are

   6     caught.  Don't say you're sorry, lie to your

   7     own witness afterward, and then say, no, treat

   8     me differently because I was complete and

   9     truthful.

  10               Demonstrated acceptance of

  11     responsibility?  Hi, I murdered 11 people.  I

  12     injured many.  I'm not sorry.  I'm not sorry

  13     Tanzanians died.  I'm not sorry my countrymen

  14     died.  I'm not sorry my fellow Muslims died.  I

  15     wanted Americans to die.  I hope people keep

  16     killing Americans.  That's not acceptance.

  17               What he did to Officer Pepe, part of

  18     the process to make sure that he gets a chance

  19     for a fair trial, that's not acceptance.

  20               We'll talk about Dr. Post in a

  21     moment.  That's not acceptance either.

  22               I submit to you it's offensive to put

  23     before you credit for acceptance of

  24     responsibility and truth when he threatens and

  25     attacks an officer.  I submit to you his lack

   2     of remorse, his coldness, his feeling nothing

   3     for the victims is something that will stay

   4     with him forever.  Part of what makes him

   5     dangerous while confined.  He doesn't see

   6     anything wrong.  He has no conscience.  He will

   7     do it again.

   8               Provided the agents with valuable

   9     information:  Remember that he told them they

  10     had papers which showed him he was charged when

  11     they caught him.  It came out in

  12     cross-examination that they basically knew

  13     everything.  They had been to the bomb factory.

  14     They had seen the Suzuki truck.  They had the

  15     lease.  They had analyzed the house.  They had

  16     talked to the person who rented the house.

  17     They talked to the neighbor.  They talked to

  18     the house girl.  They talked to the juice cafe

  19     owner who knew he went to Afghanistan.  They

  20     had been to his house.  They had been to his

  21     family.  They had the explosives results.  No

  22     showing he told them anything significant they

  23     didn't know.

  24               And the judge has told you in the

  25     guilt phase the last time that statements of a

   2     defendant after, when they were being

   3     interviewed for an arrest, were only admitted

   4     against him.  They weren't admitted against

   5     anyone else at the last trial.  They are

   6     useless against anyone else.  No showing that

   7     he helped identify anyone else involved in this

   8     plot, no showing that he identified anyone who

   9     could be arrested, no showing that that

  10     statement could ever result in someone being

  11     brought to justice.  What value?

  12               D.  Mitigating factor is that the

  13     alternative to a sentence of death is that he

  14     will spend the rest of his life in prison.  I

  15     submit to you that's true.  We don't dispute it

  16     is true.  You can check it as being proven.

  17     You have been told that by the judge, but it's
