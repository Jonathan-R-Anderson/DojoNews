  10   the distance of how long it took us to get there.

  11   Q.  So you visited the bomb site; is that correct?

  12   A.  I did on the second day I was there.

  13   Q.  And what day would that have been, what day of the month?

  14   A.  You know, I'm not certain.  I think I arrived -- I think I

  15   arrived, my recollection was the 6th, which was late, and then

  16   I think we went to the site on the 7th.  I'm not certain.

  17   Q.  To orient you, the bombing was on August 7th, 1998.

  18   A.  Okay, then I know I went to the site the day after I

  19   arrived and I did not arrive immediately after the bombing.

  20   It was the weekend.

  21   Q.  But your purpose in going to Kenya was to assist in the

  22   investigation of the bombing; is that correct?

  23   A.  That's correct.

  24   Q.  And the bombing was on a Friday and you got there sometime

  25   over the weekend?

   5   while.

   6   Q.  I understand.  And you're no longer with the agency?

   7   A.  That's correct.  Well, I'm a contractor with the agency.

  13   Q.  On August 20th, 1998, your task on that day was to receive

  14   these items from the Kenyan police officials, is that correct?

  16   Q.  And the physical transfer of the items took place in an

  17   office or in a lounge area or where?

  18   A.  Yes, in a lounge area.

  19   Q.  When you first saw the items in question, where were they?

  20   A.  They were in this gym bag.

  21   Q.  Where was the gym bag?

  22   A.  It was given to me in that room.  It was brought to me in

  23   that room.

  24   Q.  Do you remember who brought it to you?

  25   A.  If I can refer to this exhibit, I would be able to give
