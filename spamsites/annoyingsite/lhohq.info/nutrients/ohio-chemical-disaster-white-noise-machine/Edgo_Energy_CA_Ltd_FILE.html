   1   Q   And can you tell us whether or not the translations that

   2   you did are fair and accurate translations of the Arabic

   3   originals?

   4   A   Yes, they are.

   5   Q   And how is it that you signified that they are accurate?

   6   A   I went through the Arabic a few times and then translated

   7   them, and I reviewed them more than once, actually.

   8   Q   And when you finished reviewing the translations, did you

   9   do anything to the translations themselves, the documents?

  10   A   I changed a few things, yes.  I went back to make them

  11   look better.

  12   Q   When you were done, did you have a chance to review the

  13   translations one last time?

  14   A   Yes, I did.

  15   Q   Did you do anything to the translations?  Did you initial

  16   and date them?

  17   A   Yes, I initial and dated them, yes.

  18            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, we offer the exhibits I

  19   listed earlier.

   8            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, at this time we would like to

   9   display some of the exhibits, and we will start, if we could,

  10   with Government Exhibit 1626A, which is one of the documents

  11   downloaded from the computer disk found in 94 Dewsbury, Khalid

  12   al Fawwaz's residence, and if we could display 1626A-T.

  13            And if we could focus on the first three entries,

  14   Khalid, the message, and ARC, on the full screen.  The first

  15   row, Khalid, the second reads the message, and across under

  16   the column marked Cr. Date, 31/7/96, 11:31 a.m.

  17            The next row across 184 reads under the column Cr.

  18   Date, 31/8/96, 10:31 a.m.  The next, K5, the next row reading

  19   across under Cr. Date, 1/9/96, 8 p.m.

  22   Holy War against the Americans Who are Occupying the Land of

  23   the Two Holy Places.  Expel the polytheist out of the Arabian

  24   Peninsula.  A message from Usama Bin Muhammed Bin Landen.  The

  25   to the Muslim brethren worldwide and specially in the Arabian



                                                                3711



   1   Peninsula."

   2            And if we could display 1626C, and then if we could

   3   display 1626C-T.  And reading the title, "Declaration of Holy

   4   War Against the Americans who Are Occupying the Land of the

   5   Two Holy Places."

   6            Below, the next line, "A message from Usama Bin

   7   Muhammed Bin Laden to his Muslim brethren worldwide and

   8   specially in the Arabian Peninsula."

   9            For the record, 1626B and C are two of the documents

  10   found on the disk located in 94 Dewsbury.

  11            Next if we could display 1600A, the first page, and

  16   if we could display 1628A-T, I believe it is.  Reading again
