  19   it will be.  When I say losing sleep, you know, of course, I

  20   am talking about my law clerks.

  21            MR. COHN:  At my age it doesn't matter.  The less I

  22   get, the more it prolongs other things.

  23            The other thing, Ms. Gasiorowski suggests, and I

  24   believe it is only fair, I believe the government's proof as

  25   to Somalia, which I understand they are offering, is not



                                                                4341



   1   probative, or not very probative of the charges in the

   2   indictment and highly unnecessarily prejudicial under Rule

   3   403, and at some point I want to be heard about that and I

   4   guess it is only fair to do that before we hear the witness.

   5   I will be glad to do that tomorrow or sometime before the

   6   witness comes in.  As I read the indictment, the testimony

   7   that they are offering does really not meet those issues.

   8            THE COURT:  You want to respond to that now?

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  No, Judge, and if we are going to

  10   deal with that issue I think we should tee up the issue of the

  11   Somalia expert that the defense is intending to call, all at

  12   one time.

  13            THE COURT:  I am trying to suggest to you that that

  14   may never happen.

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  OK.  No one had told us that.

  16            MR. COHN:  I will be glad to address it in back

  17   today.  I just don't want to spread this all out on the record

  18   with the press here, quite frankly.

  19            THE COURT:  Why don't we put on the agenda for Monday

  20   as part of the charging conference defendant Al-'Owhali's

  21   motion to strike the allegations with respect to Somalia from

  22   the redacted indictment.  I take it that the redacted

  23   indictment includes Somalia.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.

  25            MR. COHN:  That's a way to do it.  I just don't want



                                                                4342



   1   to surprise the court, that's all, and cause undue delay as

   2   opposed to some necessary delay.

   3            THE COURT:  I appreciate that.

   4            Is there anything I have omitted?  Anything that is

   5   open?

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.  On scheduling, I

   7   strongly feel that to require the government to sum up next

   8   week would be unfair in light of the circumstances --

   9            THE COURT:  It is highly unlikely.  It is highly

  10   unlikely.  Why don't we play it that the government will have

  11   at least two days' notice.

  12            MR. FITZGERALD:  Judge, in all seriousness, two days'

  13   notice is way too late.  We have been up all night many a

  14   night and we --

  15            THE COURT:  All right, fair enough, but as soon as a

  16   week from Monday.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.  Thank you.

  18            THE COURT:  Anything else?  Then I will be in

  19   chambers tomorrow if there is anything that requires my

  20   attention.

  21            MR. RICCO:  Your Honor, tomorrow morning at 9:30 Mr.

  22   Odeh would like to be in the courtroom to go over evidence.

  23   The government will have evidence, if the marshals will have

  24   Mr. Odeh in the courtroom.

  25            THE COURT:  You want me to instruct the marshals that



                                                                4343



   1   Mr. Odeh should be brought to the courtroom tomorrow at 9:30?

   2            MR. RICCO:  Yes.

   3            THE COURT:  They are so instructed.

   4            MR. WILFORD:  Excuse me, your Honor.  Can I see you

   5   for a brief moment?

   6            THE COURT:  Sure.

   7            (Pause)

   8            THE COURT:  There is one other matter we want to put

   9   on the record while the defendants are still present.  Mr.

  10   Wilford, you have advised me that both you and Mr. Ricco have

  11   an appearance required in the Court of Appeals at 9:30 on

  12   Monday but that Mr. Herman will be here.

  13            MR. WILFORD:  That is correct, your Honor.

  14            THE COURT:  Is it agreeable to Mr. Odeh that the

  15   matters go forward so long as Mr. Herman is present?

  16            MR. WILFORD:  Your Honor, I am sorry.  Mr. Odeh

  17   doesn't have his headphones on.  Can we have a moment so he

  18   can hear what the court inquired?

  19            THE COURT:  Yes.

  20            DEFENDANT ODEH:  No problem, no objection.

  21            THE COURT:  That is agreeable to you, Mr. Odeh, so

  22   that we can go forward as long as Mr. Herman is here?

  23            DEFENDANT ODEH:  No problem.

  24            (Adjourned until Monday, April 23, 2001, at 10:00

  25   a.m.)



                                                                4344
