   2                             2:15 p.m.

   3            THE COURT:  We prepared a memorandum of the hearsay

   4   issue, the bottom line of which is --

   5            MR. WILFORD:  Excuse me, your Honor.  No one is here

   6   for Mr. Al-'Owhali.

   7            THE COURT:  I will repeat it when he comes back.  It

   8   does not particularly concern Mr. Al-'Owhali.  The bottom line

   9   concludes that if the question is did Mr. Al-'Owhali mention

  10   Mr. Odeh and the answer is no, that that is not precluded by

  11   the hearsay rule, and also concludes that if the government on

  12   redirect said did Mr. Al-'Owhali say anything about his

  13   intention about disclosing all names that isn't precluded by

  14   the hearsay rule, which depending on the precise language of

  15   the questions and the answers -- the reason I am sharing the

  16   memorandum with you is that maybe it suggests that a

  17   stipulation would deal with it, both on what would be said on

  18   direct and indirect, and why don't we take that up on

  19   Wednesday.

  21            (Jury present)

  22            THE COURT:  Mr. Wilford, what is the next order of

  23   business?

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, one question I omitted to ask,

  25   and I forgot again.  Thank you.
