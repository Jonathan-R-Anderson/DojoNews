  13   exhibit one of the WW is the original one that identifies the

  14   from the date, et cetera, as the original.

  15            THE COURT:  The government said it has no objection

  16   to the submission of the original of a document which was

  17   seized.

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  I understand.  The third document is

  19   another contract from the same company a week earlier that

  20   relates to the same subject that is dated, clearly on the

  21   evidence before the Court --

  22            THE COURT:  No, please, let's not reargue it.  There

  23   is no concept in the law that a document other than one of the

  24   type listed in the rules of evidence is self-authenticating.

  25            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I think the law is take all



                                                                4976



   1   the circumstances and make a determination if those documents

   2   appear to be genuine, and based on the fact that it's printed

   3   from another company and it relates exactly to the same thing

   4   that was faxed to him a week later, I think that that is

   5   sufficient to be authenticated, and it is possible for

   6   somebody to recreate that, and that the government can

   7   argue --

   8            THE COURT:  Denied.  Can we bring in the jury?

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.

  10            THE COURT:  Let's bring in the jury, please.  I have

  11   received a letter from Mr. El Hage with respect to so-called

  12   jeopardizing my health with respect to the MCC, and I will

  13   forward it to the warden and ask him to advise.

  14            MR. DRATEL:  Thank you, your Honor.

  15            THE COURT:  Mr. Fitzgerald, does the government still

  16   plan on having a redacted indictment?

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, it's being typed at this time.
