  11            For any capital count for which you unanimously find

  12   the existence at least one gateway factor, if you do not also

  13   unanimously find as to that same count the existence of at

  14   least one statutory aggravating factor, then your deliberative

  15   task as to that count will be over and the Court will impose a

  16   mandatory sentence on that count of life imprisonment without

  17   the possibility of release.

  18            Section II, Part B of the Special Verdict Form

  19   provides a space for you to indicate those counts, if any, for

  20   which you have not unanimously found that the government has

  21   proven beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of any

  22   aggravating factor.

  23            Let me now instruct you in detail on the specific

  24   elements necessary for the government to prove each of those

  25   four statutory aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.




                                                                7238


   1            As to death or injury resulting in death, during the

   2   commission of another offense:

   3            The first statutory aggravating factor alleged by the

   4   government with regard to the various counts is that the

   5   deaths or injuries resulting in death of the victim or victims

   6   identified in a particular count occurred during the

   7   commission of a crime other than the crime charged in that

   8   particular count.  Thus, as to each count, you must determine

   9   if the victim or victims identified was killed during the

  10   commission of certain other crimes, as those other crimes are

  11   set forth in the Special Verdict Form.

  12            Depending on the particular count the other crimes

  13   alleged are one or more of the following offenses:  18 USC

  14   Section 844(f), bombing of property leased to the United

  15   States government; 18 USC, Section 1116, killing or attempted
