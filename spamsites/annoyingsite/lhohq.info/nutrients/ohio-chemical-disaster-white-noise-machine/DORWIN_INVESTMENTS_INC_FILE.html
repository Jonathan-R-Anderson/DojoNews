  24   mujahadeen because it is in the national interests of the

  25   United States to support what they are doing in Afghanistan.



                                                                5868



   1            Khalfan Mohamed is 16 years old.

   2            At age 17 in 1990, he moves to Dar es Salaam to live

   3   and to work.  As you may imagine, the opportunities in Kidimni

   4   are few.  And he begins to work with his brother who has a

   5   store in Dar es Salaam.  The evidence is that Khalfan Khamis

   6   Mohamed did not grow up in a very religious household.  In

   7   fact, his family is not very religious at all.  It's really at

   8   age 16 and 17, when he moves to Dar es Salaam, that he begins

   9   to study Islam for the first time with any degree of

  10   seriousness.

  11            He begins to attend a mosque in the Ilala section of

  12   Dar es Salaam and he is befriended by a man from Mombasa,

  13   Kenya, named Sulieman, whose full name is Suleiman Abdallah,

  14   and he begins, as it says, his first serious studies of Islam.

  15            The world events continue to move forward, and in

  16   that same year, Iraq, another Muslim country, invades Kuwait,

  17   another Muslim country, on the Saudi Peninsula, and what we

  18   call the Gulf War begins.  And the United States, under

  19   President George Bush, the first George Bush president, I'll

  20   call him George Bush 41 and George Bush 43, because I recently

  21   learned George Bush was the 41st president and George Bush now

  22   is the 43rd, but under George Bush 41, the Gulf War begins.

  23            The United States sends troops to Saudi Arabia.  The

  24   king of Saudi Arabia, King Fahd, invites the American troops

  25   into what to many Muslims is a sacrilege into the land of the



                                                                5869



   1   two holy places, as we have heard it referred to from time to

   2   time, Mecca and Medina, the two holiest sites in Islam.

   3            And very quickly, by January 1991 Iraq is defeated.

   4   Saddam Hussein is not deposed, removed from government,

   5   remains in government, but Iraq is defeated, is driven from

   6   Kuwait, but the United States forces remain in Saudi Arabia,

   7   indeed, where they remain today.

   8            In 1994, Khalfan Mohamed has continued to pursue his

   9   studies of Islam.  As you will see, if you dig into the

  10   statement, he listens to lectures, he listens to cassette

  11   recordings, he listens to scholars and other teachers to tell

  12   him about Islam, and he meets a man named Fahid, who is Fahid

  13   Mohammed Ally, who tells Khalfan Khamis Mohamed that although

  14   he is a nice man, he does not trust Khalfan Mohamed, but if he

  15   went to Afghanistan and got some training, perhaps then he

  16   would trust him.

  17            And Khalfan Mohamed goes to Afghanistan through

  18   Karachi, into Afghanistan, into a camp that is primarily run

  19   by Pakistani people.  It's supported by groups from Pakistan.

  20   The teachers and the leaders at the camp are from Pakistan.

  21   You will learn that it was his belief that his reason and

  22   purpose for going to training was to learn how to help other

  23   Muslims, if necessary, through arms struggle, and he thought

  24   he might go to Bosnia to help Muslim people there.

  25            The quotes are from his statement.  I'm not just



                                                                5870



   1   giving you the quotes, they are contained within his

   2   statement.

   3            Now, the government argues in an effort, perhaps, to

   4   put Khalfan Mohamed into a conspiracy that is existing long

   5   before he becomes aware of it and into a conspiracy that is

   6   aimed at killing Americans.  Remember, the first Count of this

   7   indictment is a conspiracy to kill Americans.  The government

   8   claims that by going to Afghanistan and taking training,

   9   Khalfan Mohamed has joined the conspiracy and is participating

  10   in it.

  11            Mr. Karas, in summing up for the government, made the

  12   statement, well, we had the witness Hamisi who said Khalfan

  13   Mohamed realized that his training camp was underwritten by

  14   Usama Bin Laden.  If wishes were horses, they say beggars

  15   would ride.  It's not that the government has a lot to wish

  16   for in its proofs again Khalfan Mohamed, but that was a

  17   misunderstanding of what Mr. Hamisi actually said.

  18            The question that Mr. Karas actually asked of

  19   Mr. Hamisi was the following, and the transcript reference is

  20   there for you:

  21            "Did Khalfan tell you who it was that he believed had

  22   financed the training he had taken?"  And the witness, like

  23   witnesses often do, especially witnesses who are not

  24   sophisticated, answers the question two different ways.  He

  25   says:  "He mentioned to me, he says Usama Bin Laden is the one



                                                                5871



   1   who helps a lot of groups over there."  So you got one piece

   2   of information.  Usama Bin Laden helps a lot of groups over

   3   there in Afghanistan.  "But he didn't go into detail that he

   4   received that help."

   5            This was not an act in furtherance of this

   6   overarching conspiracy.  What was it?  An effort to be trusted

   7   by people he greatly, greatly respected and wanted to be part

   8   of.

   9            So what happened after 1995?  One thing that did not

  10   happen is that he was not asked to join al Qaeda.  You will

  11   recall Mr. Kherchtou's testimony that what would happen after

  12   the training in Afghanistan is that the best prospects would

  13   be pulled aside, taken aside and asked to become a member of

  14   al Qaeda.  He was not asked to do that.

  15            In fact, after the training was over, what Khalfan

  16   Mohamed did was he returned to Afghanistan by himself.  He
