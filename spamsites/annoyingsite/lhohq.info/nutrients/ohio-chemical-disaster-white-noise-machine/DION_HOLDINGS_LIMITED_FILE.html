                              Opening - Butler

   1            (In open court; jury not present )

   2            THE COURT:  The juror who wants to take his wife to

   3   the hospital on February 14th is trying to make arrangements

   4   and on Friday evening if he is able to do that, he thinks that

   5   he would be available around 9:30.  On that day we may start a

   6   little late, but we should be able to sit that day.  Let's

   7   bring in the jurors, please.

   8            Exhibit D on January 1 which was the blank

   9   questionnaire was sealed and is unsealed now, so blank copies

  10   of the jury questionnaire are available if anyone wants them.

  11   The completed questionnaires we'll keep sealed at least for

  12   the present because they contain material which might disclose

  13   the identity of the juror.
