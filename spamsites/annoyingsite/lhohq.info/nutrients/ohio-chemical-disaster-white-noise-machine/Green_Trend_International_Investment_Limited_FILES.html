<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  14   in any event.  The masterminds behind the two bombings

  15   obviously thought that there would be a greater impact by

  16   having a simultaneous explosion, but there is nothing that he

  17   does -- he, Al-'Owhali, does -- which furthers the Dar es

  18   Salaam bombing itself.

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  Two points.  First, your Honor,

  20   Section 2 is charged in the indictment explicitly.  Secondly,

  21   I believe the testimony from Agent Gaudin was that they were

  22   to make a phone call before the bombings happened to make sure

  23   they're still on and the central people will know that the

  24   Nairobi bombing may be prominent, but if Al-'Owhali doesn't

  25   carry out the Nairobi bombing and they can't go forward on



                                                                3922



   1   Friday, August 7th, they may not go forward in Dar es Salaam.

   2   The headquarters want to know that this is happening.

   3            THE COURT:  But the indictment itself separates the

   4   two.  You put the Nairobi bombing in one series of counts and

   5   you put the Tanzania bombing in another series of counts.  The

   6   indictment itself treats them as independent.

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  The indictment treats every victim

   8   killed independently as well, but it doesn't mean that the

   9   person is not responsible for all the people killed.  There

  10   may be 11 counts in Dar es Salaam and maybe 211 in Nairobi,

  11   separate counts, but the enterprise, the way they looked at

  12   it, they were doing two bombings simultaneously and he

  13   expressly knew that at the time he carried out the bombing.

  14            THE COURT:  I think that is not sufficient for aiding

  15   and abetting and I will grant the motions to dismiss as to the

  16   substantive Tanzania counts as to Al-'Owhali, and those would

  17   be the same counts that we had previously discussed, 8, 10,

  18   282, 286, 277, 279, 224 to 234.

  19            Now I have some other specific things, but one of

  20   the -- there are two consequences on that --

  21            MR. RICCO:  Judge, it may not be an important point,
