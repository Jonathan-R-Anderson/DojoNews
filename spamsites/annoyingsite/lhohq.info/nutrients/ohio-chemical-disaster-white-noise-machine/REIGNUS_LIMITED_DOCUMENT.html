   5   her.  She told us, we got to get out of here.  It's not safe.

   6   She was reluctant to move.  She kept saying, I can't find my

   7   shoes.  I can't leave without my shoes.  And we were, we had

   8   to get out.  I gave her my shoes, said, let's go, let's get

   9   out.  And we got out the front of the building, and that's

  10   when I saw that it must have been a bomb.

  11   Q   Were you able to make it out of the embassy compound?

  12   A   We moved around the side of the building going off to the

  13   right.  Somebody had called us in that direction and we went

  14   around the side of the building, and I remember seeing a

  15   tanker truck sitting there, and I didn't really want to go

  16   where the tanker truck was because it's not safe.  But we

  17   moved.  I asked my other colleague standing there if we could

  18   move a little bit away from the tanker truck maybe be in a

  19   safer location.  And we finally got here.  He didn't have

  20   any -- he died.

  21   Q   Ms. Slater, were you able to get to the ambassador's

  22   residence?

  23   A   Yes.  We had got over the embassy wall and were taken in

  24   little taxis to Ambassador Lange's house.

  25            MR. KARAS:  Thank you.  Your Honor, I have no further

   2            MR. RUHNKE:  We have no questions.

   3            MR. BAUGH:  No questions.

   4            THE COURT:  Thank you, ma'am.  You may step down.
