  16   of the commode or the toilet right there, and that is a, it's

  17   a prayer rug between the commode and a chair that was bolted

  18   down to the floor.

  19   Q.  If we could go to 4018, is that the area shown that you

  20   were just speaking about?

  21   A.  Yes, sir, that's correct.

  22   Q.  Again, these items center, lower center of the photograph,

  23   white and orange, what were they?

  24   A.  White and orange?

  25   Q.  Yes.




                                                                7885


   1   A.  The orange pieces of material appear to have been like

   2   cuffs or sleeves that were possibly pulled off an orange-type

   3   jumpsuit, and the white garments in there are clothing.

   4   Q.  The item of furniture on the left-hand wall past the

   5   chair, what is that?

   6   A.  I'm sorry, sir?  The items of --

   7   Q.  On the left-hand wall past the chair that you described

   8   earlier, was that part of the wall?  In fact, is that a desk?

   9   A.  Yes, sir.  It's a concrete desk and chair that are not

  10   movable.  They are permanent items there in the cell.

  11   Q.  During the course of your examination of the crime scene,

  12   did you look underneath the desk?

  13   A.  I did, sir.

  14   Q.  And if we could have Government Exhibit 4039, could you

  15   tell us what that is?

  16   A.  Yes, sir.  Underneath the desk itself were scrape marks

  17   that appeared to be black and white in color.  It was

  18   underneath the portion of the desk that wasn't painted.

  19   Q.  As you looked at those marks underneath the desk, what

  20   direction were they going in?

  21   A.  Basically back and forth, so it would be going from the

  22   interior of the cell towards the cell wall.

  23   Q.  So from the front of the desk to the wall?

  24   A.  That's correct.

  25   Q.  And I would like to show you Government Exhibits 4080




                                                                7886


   1   through 4086.  Have you had a chance to look at those before

   2   coming to court today?

   3   A.  I did, sir.

   4   Q.  Are those the orange and white strips that you described

   5   for us earlier in the cell?

   6   A.  Yes, sir.

   7            MR. GARCIA:  Your Honor, at this time we would offer

   8   Government Exhibits 4080 through 4086.

   9            THE COURT:  Received.

  10            (Government Exhibits 4080 through 4086 received in

  11   evidence)

  12   BY MR. STERN:

  13   Q.  If you would, using the gloves, Agent, could you just hold

  14   up 4082 for us and display it.

  15   A.  (Witness complies)

  16   Q.  Again, those markings weren't on it when you found it; is

  17   that correct?

  18   A.  That's correct.

  19            THE COURT:  The black markings and circles and so on,

  20   those were all added?

  21            THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.  They were added by the lab

  22   personnel when they had done their presumptive tests.

  23   BY MR. GARCIA:

  24   Q.  The other marks, the stains, those were on it when you

  25   found it?




                                                                7887


   1   A.  That's correct.

   2            THE COURT:  All right.  Is this a good place to

   3   break?

   4            MR. GARCIA:  Yes, your Honor.

   5            THE COURT:  We'll take our midmorning recess at this

   6   point.

   7            We'll take a five-minute recess.

   8            (Recess)

   9            (Jury not present)

  10            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor at 1:00 we would just like to

  11   see you on some minor housekeeping-type matters.

  12            (Jury enters)

  13    LEONARD HATTON, resumes

  14            THE COURT:  You may proceed.

  15            MR. GARCIA:  Thank you, Judge.

  16   BY MR. GARCIA:

  17   Q.  Agent, I'm showing you Government Exhibit 4090.  Could you

  18   just generally describe for us what that is?

  19   A.  Yes.  This is a plastic wrap, like Saran Wrap, rolled into

  20   a twine.

  21   Q.  And did you find the items in that Government Exhibit 4090

  22   inside Cell 6?

  23   A.  Yes, sir.  They were found on the floor alongside of the

  24   center of the cell and over by the leg of the bed number 1.
