   1   not specifically invoked Rule 16.

   2            MR. BAUGH:  No, your Honor, that's correct, but under

   3   the Officer Pepe incident, for instance, the first motion we

   4   filed was a Brady issue as to Officer Pepe and it was not

   5   invoking --

   6            THE COURT:  Tell me how -- if I may interrupt you.

   7            MR. BAUGH:  Yes, sir.

   8            THE COURT:  -- how the discovery request that you

   9   have in fact made differs from the discovery requests that

  10   would be made under Rule 16.

  11            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, I don't believe we have filed

  12   a discovery request for the penalty phase.  If I'm in error --

  13            MR. COHN:  We haven't.

  14            MR. BAUGH:  We have never filed a Rule 16 penalty

  15   request.

  16            THE COURT:  So I should tell the government now that

  17   if it is in possession of any documents or materials that it

  18   has not furnished to you, it need not do so.

  19            MR. BAUGH:  No, your Honor, because, no, here's why.

  20   If there are documents that must be tendered in compliance

  21   with Brady or notice, then they have to do it.  If it is

  22   general Rule 16 discovery, they do not.  We have couched all

  23   our requests in terms of notice and Brady.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, first of all, I think we

  25   should take back the packet we gave over this morning.  I




                                                                6439


   1   think we should strike the motion, and I think they should

   2   give back the discovery.  We always understood that this was

   3   discovery in a case of capital prosecution.  No one, until the

   4   other day for the first time, brought up the notion that they

   5   were splitting discovery between the guilt phase and the

   6   punishment phase, and I think it's ridiculous.

   7            THE COURT:  I don't know that that's what it is, but

   8   I would say it's certainly inappropriate in any case but

   9   especially inappropriate when we're talking about a death

  10   penalty case.

  11            The fact that counsel have not insisted on dotting

  12   every I and crossing every T in furnishing material in

  13   response to the urge requests of defendants it seems to me was

  14   commendable.  Now you take the position that you have not

  15   asked for anything which was not compelled by Brady, or you

  16   mentioned something else.

  17            MR. BAUGH:  Notice.

  18            THE COURT:  Or notice.

  19            MR. BAUGH:  Which case law says we're entitled to

  20   which are constitutionally based and are not governed by Rule

  21   16.

  22            THE COURT:  I will advise the government then that

  23   unless required by Brady or 601, the government need not

  24   furnish any material to defense counsel since defense counsel

  25   has explicitly disclaimed any right to any material other than




                                                                6440


   1   Brady or 601.

   2            MR. BAUGH:  That's correct.  If I might --

   3            THE COURT:  You have no problem with that.

   4            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, and the file --

   5            THE COURT:  Mr. Ruhnke, do you have any problem with

   6   that?

   7            MR. RUHNKE:  Judge, let me --

   8            THE COURT:  Let's take a five minute recess.

   9            MR. RUHNKE:  We consider ourselves engaging in Rule

  10   16 discovery.

  11            THE COURT:  Excuse me?

  12            MR. RUHNKE:  We consider ourselves to be engaging in

  13   Rule 16 discovery and have been.

  14            THE COURT:  Very well.  That does not apply then to

  15   counsel for KK Mohamed.  Isn't this absurd?

  16            MR. BAUGH:  No, your Honor.  We didn't even know

  17   until Mr. Fitzgerald made that statement last week about Rule

  18   16 discovery that anyone was under the impression that had

  19   been triggered.  That's how come I stood up and made the

  20   statement.

  21            THE COURT:  Are you sanguine that when you are second

  22   guessed, and the history of this type of litigation is that

  23   counsel are always second guessed by successor counsel --

  24            MR. BAUGH:  Of course --

  25            THE COURT:  -- that you will not be criticized for
