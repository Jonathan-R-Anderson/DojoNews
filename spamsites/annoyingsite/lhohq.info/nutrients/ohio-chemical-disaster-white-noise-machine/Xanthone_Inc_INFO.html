  22            We can go to the next page, and he goes ahead and he

  23   gives him that telephone number in Baku.  And down at the

  24   bottom, which has been cut off, there's a reference to the

  25   name of Saad.



                                                                5303



   1            Now if we go to Government Exhibit 204A-T, what you

   2   see here, this is a call November 6, 1996, and El Hage is

   3   talking to DHL because he forgot to put an important letter in

   4   a package and he wants to know if he can get it back.  And

   5   then what happens is DHL calls El Hage back later on that day

   6   on November 6 and tells him that he can pick up the package.

   7            Six days later, as we know from Government Exhibit

   8   205A-T, which is a conversation on November 12, and this is El

   9   Hage talking to Saif al Islam, as you can see there, and if we

  10   can go to the second page and you see down there at the

  11   bottom, "I was waiting to get notebooks here."  Saif al Islam

  12   is waiting to get the notebooks, and one of the codes you

  13   learned about was "books" is the code for passports.

  14            In 207C-T, which is a conversation on December 17,

  15   '96, again involving Wadih El Hage and Wadih El Hage and this

  16   person Saad in Baku.  Saad says:  "Concerning Abu al-Darda',

  17   have you sent him the notebook?"  El Hage says:  "Yes, a long

  18   time ago, but they never told us whether they had received it

  19   or not."

  20            Remember, Dardaa is the person whose name appears in

  21   El Hage's address book.  Dardaa is the person who sends the

  22   letter to Harun that talks about the Yemeni and the Turkish

  23   and the gold seal.  And you know "the books" are used as code

  24   for passports, and Saad says:  "Did you send him anything else

  25   with it for Suhail and the other?"  For the other people did



                                                                5304



   1   you send the passports.  And El Hage says:  "Yes, yes, it was

   2   with it, but we didn't do anything to them."  So El Hage is

   3   distinguishing what he did with some of the passports but not

   4   with all of the passports.

   5            And then Saad asks:  "What about the green one?  Did

   6   you do anything to it?"  And you see in the passports, they

   7   come in different colors, and El Hage says:  "Oh, let me

   8   think.  It's been a while.  Let me ask Harun about it because

   9   I remember he said it was better not to do anything to it,

  10   otherwise, the projects would get ruined."

  11            So El Hage and Harun are working together to fix some

  12   of these passports and Saad goes on to say:  "So regarding Abu

  13   al Dardaa's, it had been fixed and sent then?"  And El Hage

  14   says:  "Yes."  El Hage says:  Abu al Dardaa's is fine and

  15   fixed, and we sent it to him."  Again, Wadih El Hage is acting

  16   as the facilitator on behalf of al Qaeda to make sure, working

  17   behind the scenes, that the essentials that need to get done

  18   get down on behalf of al Qaeda.

  19            Now, we get to 1997.  In 1997, ladies and gentlemen,

  20   you are going to remember that there were two trips that El

  21   Hage took to see Usama Bin Laden, and the first one takes

  22   place in February 1997.  And bear in mind, this is five or six

  23   months after Bin Laden has publicly declared war on the United

  24   States, after he says that all resources should be pooled to

  25   kill the United States, to drive the American forces out of



                                                                5305



   1   Saudi Arabia.  And in spite of the denials that El Hage will

   2   give to the Grand Jury, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that

   3   El Hage went to Afghanistan.  He went to Afghanistan to visit

   4   with Bin Laden and Abu Hafs.  We can go through that evidence

   5   right now.

   6            First, on January 29, 1997, as we know from

   7   Government Exhibit 594, again this is the minutes used on that

   8   satellite phone, there is a call from the satellite phone on

   9   January 29 to 25471202219.  That is the mobile phone that El

  10   Hage uses, and you know 254 is the country code for Kenya.

  11            On February 3, 1997, there are telephone calls from

  12   that mobile number, and we know that from the mobile phone

  13   records.  And so you know, those are Government Exhibit 621C.

  14   There is a call from the mobile phone to the number 521272177.

  15   And if we go to the pop-up phone book, Government Exhibit

  16   304-27, you see that that number I just read to you, 21272177,

  17   is listed for Taysir, and Taysir is one of the names that El

  18   Hage is going to use for Abu Hafs.  And we'll go through that

  19   some more.  So the satellite phone calls El Hage on January

  20   29.  El Hage calls back on February 7 to Taysir, Abu Hafs, on

  21   February 3.

  22            And by the way, you see that number also appear in

  23   the planner that's found in El Hage's house, Government

  24   Exhibit 350.  In the lower right there, Taysir, Box 35341,

  25   272177.



                                                                5306



   1            On January 30, and we don't have to pull up the

   2   records, but the satellite phone calls 820067.  That's the

   3   land line at Fedha Estates that belongs to El Hage.

   4            Then, on January 30, there is a call that is

   5   intercepted and it's the transcript containing Government

   6   Exhibit 209A-T.  And it's call from Abu Khadija, and we know

   7   that Abu Khadija is one of the aliases for Abu Hafs.  That's

   8   in Government Exhibit 4-2, I believe.  And that conversation

   9   involves Abu Khadija, Abu Hafs and April El Hage.  And Abu

  10   Khadija asks:  "Is he," referring to Abu Hafs, "present."

  11   April says:  "He is notice present.  He is out.  He may come

  12   after two hours."  And so he leaves a message.

  13            What you know from Government Exhibit 209B-T, which I
