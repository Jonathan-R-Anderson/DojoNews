<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  19   However, the Saudi regime did not like this and started to

  20   exercise pressure on the Sudanese regime.  The US government,

  21   the Egyptian government and the Yemeni government also helped

  22   in doing so.  They requested me explicitly from the Sudanese

  23   regime and the pressure continued.  Saudi Arabia dropped all

  24   its conditions put to the Sudanese regime in return that I be

  25   driven out of the Sudan.  The US government had already taken



                                                                5336



   1   the same stance and pulled out its diplomatic mission from

   2   chart to Nairobi and put forth their condition to return only

   3   after I have left.

   4            You know that Bin Laden had the headquarters in Sudan

   5   up until some point in 1996 when he goes to Afghanistan and

   6   issues the declaration of jihad.  What he tells you in this

   7   statement on CNN is that he blames the US government for

   8   putting pressure on the Sudanese for driving him out of the

   9   Sudan and into Afghanistan.  He takes note of the fact that

  10   part of the pressure was by removing the diplomatic presence

  11   from Khartoum and sending it to Nairobi.  In March of 1997,

  12   Bin Laden is keenly aware of that move by the United States,

  13   and I submit to you it provides a powerful motive that Bin

  14   Laden had to hit the American Embassy in Nairobi in August

  15   1998, to get back to the United States for its diplomatic

  16   pressure on the Sudan that caused him to have to go to

  17   Afghanistan.

  18            On page 6, Bin Laden is asked about some attacks in

  19   Riyadh and in Al Khobar.  He says as to the previous question,

  20   the explosion in Riyadh and Al Khobar, it is no secret that I

  21   was not in Saudi Arabia, but I have great respect for the

  22   people who did this action.  I say, as I said before, they are

  23   heroes.  We look upon them as men who wanted to raise the flag

  24   of -- there is no God but Allah and to bring the flag of

  25   nonbelievers and of injustice that the US brought.  So he is



                                                                5337



   1   lauding the efforts of some other people who participated in,

   2   as he calls it, the explosion of Riyadh and Al Khobar.  He is

   3   not taking credit for it.  He is saying I didn't do it but I

   4   applaud what they did for the reasons that you should know,

   5   that the Americans should be driven out.

   6            At the bottom of that page is a very brief reference

   7   again to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman.  You remember, he is the

   8   person that Bin Laden talks about in his August 1996

   9   declaration of jihad where he blames the American government

  10   for the arrest, something that the witness al Fadl told you,

  11   well before Bin Laden gave this interview.

  12            Then, ladies and gentlemen, on page 7, down at the

  13   bottom, Bin Laden is asked about Somalia.  Bin Laden says the

  14   US government went there with great jubilation and stayed

  15   there sometime with a strong media presence, wanting to

  16   frighten people that it is the greatest power on earth.  It

  17   went there with vanity and 28,000 soldiers to a poor unarmed

  18   people in Somalia.  The goal was to scare the Muslim world and

  19   the whole world to say that it is able to do whatever it

  20   wishes.  As soon as they reached the Mogadishu beaches, they

  21   found no one but children.  The CNN and other media started

  22   photographing them, the soldiers, with their tanks and heavy

  23   arms, and show themselves as the great power on earth.

  24   Resistance started because Muslims did not believe the US

  25   allegations that they came to save the Somalis.



                                                                5338



   1            Continuing on the next page, with Allah's grace,

   2   Muslims over there, there was a faction from the Islamic

   3   alliance that emerged and cooperated with some Mujahideen who

   4   were in Afghanistan.  They participated with their brothers

   5   against the American troops and killed large numbers of them.

   6   The American government was aware of that.  After some

   7   resistance, the American troops left without achieving

   8   anything.

   9            Down below, Bin Laden tells the world what he

  10   believed from Somalia.  We learned from those who fought there

  11   that they were surprised to see how low the spiritual morale

  12   of the American fighters was compared with the spirit of the

  13   Russian fighters.  The American fighters ran away from the

  14   fighters who fought and killed them.
