                                                                8340


   1   v. Omar Rezaq?

   2   A.  That is correct.

   3   Q.  Did you ever make clear in the article that you published

   4   in that journal that in fact you never testified?

   5   A.  I indicated that I was assisting the prosecution.  I did

   6   not indicate I testified in the article.

   7   Q.  Did you write the statement, "The other prosecution

   8   experts would demonstrate that Rezaq was legally sane but it

   9   was my task to provide a sense-making explanation for the jury

  10   of how an individual who was sane could commit such a bloody

  11   atrocity"?  Is that correct?

  12   A.  That is correct.

  13   Q.  How many members of Al Qaeda have you interviewed?

  14   A.  One.

  15   Q.  Just Mr. Odeh, correct?

  16   A.  Correct.

  17   Q.  You were asked questions before about Omar Abdel Rahman

  18   and Ramzi Yousef.  Is it fair to say you did not interview

  19   them?

  20   A.  Eminently fair.  I would be delighted to have the

  21   opportunity.

  22   Q.  Do you know a person named Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl?

  23   A.  No.

  24   Q.  Do you know who he is?

  25   A.  No.




                                                                8341


   1   Q.  Do you know a person named Kherchtou l'Houssaine, L

   2   apostrophe H-O-U-S-S-A-I-N-E?

   3   A.  Is that the Hussein in this case?

   4   Q.  Yes.

   5   A.  I don't know him.

   6   Q.  No, no, not the Hussein -- do you know, aside from the

   7   Hussein discussed with Khalfan as the person who approached

   8   him about the jihad job, do you know a person named Kherchtou

   9   l'Houssaine?

  10   A.  No.

  11   Q.  Do you know who he is?

  12   A.  No.

  13   Q.  Do you know a person by the name of Abu Ubaidah al

  14   Banshiri?

  15   A.  When you say no --

  16   Q.  Do you know who he is?

  17   A.  I need to understand the context.  Why don't you tell me

  18   what the person's role was.

  19   Q.  I am just asking you, do you recognize the name, Abu

  20   Ubaidah al Banshiri?

  21   A.  I am not terrific with names.

  22   Q.  Madani al Tayyib?

  23   A.  No.

  24   Q.  Do you know a person named Ayman al Zawahiri, A-Y-M-A-N al

  25   Z-A-W-A-H-I-R-I?




                                                                8342


   1   A.  Were you to place these in context my answer might be yes.

   2   Just by the name, I do not recognize them.

   3   Q.  Let's talk for a moment about the process of the interview

   4   with Mr. Odeh.  Is it fair to say you interviewed Mr. Odeh

   5   once?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  How long did the interview take?

   8   A.  Half an hour, 45 minutes.

   9   Q.  Is it fair to say that the government was not invited to

  10   participate in that interview?

  11   A.  Of course.

  12   Q.  Is it fair to say the government was not told about the

  13   interview in advance?

  14   A.  I don't know.  No, I don't believe that is the case, in

  15   fact, because we had to clear seeing him for me to be able to

  16   see him, with the court.

  17   Q.  Do you know if the prosecution team was told about the

  18   interview in advance?

  19   A.  I don't know.

  20   Q.  Certainly no one was invited to participate, correct?

  21   A.  Nor were they invited to participate when I talked to the

  22   defendant.  That would be most unusual.

  23   Q.  When you went in, and we will talk about that in a moment,

  24   to see Mr. Odeh, did you do a recording of the interview,

  25   audiotape or videotape?




                                                                8343


   1   A.  No.

   2   Q.  Did you take notes?

   3   A.  Yes, I did.
