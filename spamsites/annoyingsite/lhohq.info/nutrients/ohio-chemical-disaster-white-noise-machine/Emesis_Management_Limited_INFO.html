  22   closeness in facts between being a principal and aider or

  23   abettor that one could make that assumption.  But as even

  24   Judge Friendly recognized in his dictum, that would not be the

  25   case in a more complex factual situation.



                                                                5013



   1            Therefore, the Court will continue to require the

   2   jury to indicate the basis upon which it reached its verdict,

   3   that is, as either that he did the act or aided and abetted

   4   another person who did the act.

   5            MR. FITZGERALD:  Realizing I lost that, my question

   6   is, I don't understand why they have to be exclusive, why a

   7   person couldn't carry out a bombing while helping his partner,

   8   which may very well be the -- it won't be a hypothetical.

   9   Al-'Owhali is in a truck, driving a truck into an embassy, one

  10   person might say he stepped out of the truck, therefore he

  11   added and abetted the driver.

  12            THE COURT:  You want a sentence in the instruction

  13   which says, "If you find a defendant committed the offense and

  14   also aided another in the commission of the offense, then you

  15   should find him guilty as a principal?"  That's not the

  16   language that was used, but you want that expressed in the

  17   charge?

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.

  19            THE COURT:  All right, we'll handle it that way.

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  And if we could change the language

  21   here, it says, "You are to put an X next to only one of the

  22   following choices," and then it's "himself used an explosive,"

  23   then not putting an X in the second box might indicate a

  24   finding that he is not an aider and abettor and I think that's

  25   what concerns me.  Perhaps we should say "you should

   1   consider" --

   2            THE COURT:  Where are you now?

   3            MR. FITZGERALD:  On page 10 of the special verdict

   4   form.

   5            THE COURT:  Page 10 of the special verdict form.

   6   Yes.

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Right now it says, "You have to put

   8   an X next to only one of the following choices."  Then if the

   9   jury finds he is guilty as a principal but also thinks he's an
