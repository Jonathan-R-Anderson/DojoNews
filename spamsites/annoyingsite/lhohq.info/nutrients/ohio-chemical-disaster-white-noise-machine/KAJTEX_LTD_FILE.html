  24   one -- you constantly kick yourself saying maybe I should have

  25   done this, maybe I should have done more here, I should have



                                                                7093



   1   done more here, and that bedevils you for years afterwards.

   2            I can tell you I have had a lot of reservations.  I

   3   was up until early this morning wondering, because we were

   4   pulling things we didn't want to use.  We had many tapes we

   5   pulled out because we want to cut to the issue.  But at the

   6   same time you have this fear that if I get enough in, they

   7   will understand it, they will look at it; maybe if you put it

   8   from one perspective, you be put it from another, they can get

   9   it.

  10            I would ask the Court for an 18-minute gap of leeway.

  11   The BBC tape is not about this at all.  There are some

  12   different perspectives in this tape, I think you will agree,

  13   than the other that we have seen on the situation.

  14            I would also remind the Court --

  15            THE COURT:  I'm certainly not going to allow Halliday

  16   and the Albright clip again.  That's pure repetition.

  17            MR. BAUGH:  That is pure repetition and it just comes

  18   with it and we don't have the capability to edit -- if we can

  19   cut it out, fine.  If you want me to cut it off, I'll have

  20   somebody do it.  Believe me, I'll find somebody to get it

  21   done.

  22            THE COURT:  But apart from what's left from that is a

  23   plea by bishops and other clergymen for the ending of the

  24   embargo because killing innocent people is against God's law.

  25            Now, would we permit that testimony live?  Would we



                                                                7094



   1   permit a theologian to testify concerning his opposition to

   2   the Food For Oil Program and the embargo?

   3            MR. BAUGH:  Throughout the guilt phase of this case,

   4   which of course the United States has adopted for the penalty

   5   phase, words like "evil" and "heinous" have been used for the

   6   acts committed in Nairobi.  And they were.  I will concede

   7   that.  However, I think it is imperative that the jury

   8   understand that one thing that is different about this case is

   9   that we have a defendant charged with a case who -- when I

  10   used to work in the U.S. Attorney's Office, the rule of thumb

  11   was there are three reasons for all crime:  Passion, greed and

  12   crazy.  This motivation is none of the above.
