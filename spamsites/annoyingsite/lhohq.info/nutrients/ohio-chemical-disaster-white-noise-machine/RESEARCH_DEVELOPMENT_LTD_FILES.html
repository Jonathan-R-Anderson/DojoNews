   7            THE COURT:  Good morning.

   8            THE JURY:  Good morning.

   9            THE COURT:  Glad to see you all.  Hope you are all

  10   feeling well.  And the first order of business is the swearing

  11   of the marshal.

  12            Mr. Kenneally, will you swear the marshal.

  13            (Marshal sworn)

  14            THE COURT:  And ladies and gentlemen, you may return

  15   to the jury room and you may begin your deliberations.  And

  16   will the three alternates please remain in the courtroom.

  17            (The jury retires to deliberate upon a verdict at

  18   9:42 a.m.)

  19            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, my instructions to

  20   you this time are the same as the last, and that is that you

  21   are to continue to regard yourselves as being members of this

  22   jury.  You should not read, watch, listen to or anything about

  23   this case, and that you keep advised -- I assume the marshal

  24   has your telephone number, and we will let you know when the

  25   jury reaches a verdict so that you know that you are being



                                                                8745



   1   discharged.  And until that time, why, you are on-call if the

   2   need should arise.  And you are excused for the day and thank

   3   you very much for coming.

   4            ALTERNATE JURORS:  Thank you.

   5            (Alternates excused)

   6            THE COURT:  Anything?

   7            MR. RUHNKE:  No, your Honor.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  No, Judge.

   9            THE COURT:  We'll await word from the jury.  If they

  10   follow a pattern, we should get a note fairly soon with a

  11   request for whatever it is they may want to see.

  12            One lawyer for each side to remain in the courtroom.

  13            (Recess pending verdict)

  14            (In open court; time noted:  10:35 a.m.)


  15            THE COURT:  I understand there are some problems with

  16   respect to the jury's note.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.  I think we have the

  18   exhibits correlated.  There are just three issues.

  19            There is one exhibit number which does not exist,

  20   Government Exhibit 4369.  So I think we need to ask the jury

  21   what they are referring to since there is no exhibit

  22   corresponding to that exhibit.

  23            THE COURT:  4369?

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

  25            THE COURT:  Okay.



                                                                8746



   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  And then two of the exhibits the

   2   jury asked for are not in evidence, that would be 35175-C from

   3   the government exhibit list and K.K.M. 30 from the defense

   4   exhibit list.

   5            THE COURT:  Which one?

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  K.K.M.-30.

   7            THE COURT:  K.K.M.-30.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  30.

   9            THE COURT:  4369 is --

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  We don't know.  There is nothing

  11   corresponding to that number.

  12            THE COURT:  There is no exhibit with that number.

  13            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, just one matter.

  14            THE COURT:  K.K.M. 30, and what was the other one?

  15            MR. RUHNKE:  With regard to the other one --

  16            THE COURT:  Just tell me the number before you --

  17            MR. RUHNKE:  Okay.  The other one was Government

  18   Exhibit 3517S-C.

  19            THE COURT:  Yes.

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  35175-C.

  21            MR. RUHNKE:  I'm sorry.

  22            THE COURT:  What about that?

  23            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, that was not offered.  It is

  24   the rough interview notes of Correction Officer Santulli by

  25   Agent Randazzo.  We did not offer it, mostly through an



                                                                8747



   1   oversight.  We should have offered it.  I don't think the

   2   government would have objected to it had we offered it at the

   3   time.

   4            The other exhibit, K.K.M. 30, I understand the

   5   government would object to, so I'm not pushing it.  I wonder

   6   if it could be sent.

   7            MR. GARCIA:  Your Honor, with respect to 35175, it

   8   actually was offered.  The government objected.  The Court

   9   held it out and said you could call Agent Randazzo, the agent.

  10   The agent was called, he was examined on the issue, and the

  11   exhibit was never offered.

  12            But 35175-C was offered.

  13            THE COURT:  And therefore, the government's position

  14   is what?
