   1            (Trial resumed)

   2            (Pages 3570-3573 sealed)

   3            (In open court)

   4            THE COURT:  The next order of business will be what?

   5            MR. FITZGERALD:  We are going to display several

   6   documents, about five minutes worth, and the next witness will

   7   be Sohail Anjum.  The witnesses today, until we get to

   8   Sciarini, they would not like to be sketched.

   9            THE COURT:  I think there is a representative of CNN

  10   here, so they are aware of that request.

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  These witnesses all have to do with

  12   the stop of Odeh and chain of custody of clothing.

  13            THE COURT:  Am I correct that the consequence of

  14   going to daylight savings time is there is no need for a 4:30

  15   prayer break?

  16            MR. COHN:  I will seek information on that.

  17            MR. HERMAN:  I am informed the prayer break can take

  18   place after the court is in recess.

  19            (Jury present)

  20            THE COURT:  Good morning.  I apologize for a late

  21   start, because of efforts that have been made to expedite

  22   matters, and at the close of business today I hope to make a

  23   further statement to you about our schedule.  I think you will

  24   be pleased.

  25            At the close of the business on Tuesday I was handed

   1   two notes, and I did not have an opportunity to respond.  On

   2   May 10 we will not sit in the morning, to allow a juror to

   3   attend to a happy occasion, and my congratulations about that.

   4            The other note was directed to the speed with which

   5   stipulations have been read to you, especially stipulations

   6   including phone numbers, names, addresses and so on.  Counsel

   7   have rattled them off at a rate which made it difficult if not

   8   impossible to make note of all the names and numbers.  I have
