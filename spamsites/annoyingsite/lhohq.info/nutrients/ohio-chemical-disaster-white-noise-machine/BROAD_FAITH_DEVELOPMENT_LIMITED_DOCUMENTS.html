  11   factors, describe the factors as "factors in the defendant's

  12   background, record or character, or any other circumstance of

  13   the offense that mitigate against imposition of death

  14   sentence," and the way I understand Mr. Baugh's argument, he

  15   seems to construe "circumstance" of the world.  Once we go

  16   down a road of --

  17            THE COURT:  What does "any other circumstance of the

  18   offense," what -- that's a very inclusive term, isn't it?

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  It is, your Honor, but there is a

  20   limit.  "Circumstance of the offense" concerns a plot to bomb

  21   embassies in Nairobi.  It does not mean that we try before the

  22   jury, where the statute still provides that the evidence is

  23   excluded if the probative value is outweighed by a danger of

  24   unfair prejudice and confusion to the issues, that we try

  25   world history.

                                                                3552

   1            Do we try the U.S. bombing of Iraq?  Do we then prove

   2   up the response of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, invasion of

   3   the Kurds?  Do we counterbalance that with whether the U.S.

   4   did become involved in Serbia and Bosnia?  Do we go back to

   5   World War II?  Where do we stop trying warfare?  This is not

   6   warfare.  This is terrorism.  This is not conduct of lawful

   7   authority.

   8            It seems to me that to the extent it's relevant to

   9   discuss Mr. al-'Owhali's motivation, he has that information.

  10   He knows what he thought.  He has Mr. Bin Laden's statements.

  11   And if we focus on the practical, when we look at the

  12   airplanes in Saudi Arabia, we all know there are airplanes

  13   there.  Whether there is hundreds, or 1,000 or 10,000 is not

  14   relevant right now if Mr. al-'Owhali had the belief that they

  15   were there.  That fact we put before the jury.

  16            But to go down a path where we are rummaging upside

  17   down all over the government to get discovery of something of

  18   which the relevant material he already knows, he knows what he

  19   believes, he knows what he's read, he knows what he's been

  20   influenced by, and that could be put before the jury.

  21            The relevance in McVeigh is a very analogous

  22   circumstance.  They also addressed the issue of what evidence

  23   the defendant might offer in opposition to evidence of an

  24   aggravated factor, but it does not say that I can try world

  25   history.  This is an offense.  His background should be before

                                                                3553

   1   the jury, his record, his history, and the circumstances of

   2   the offense.

   3            THE COURT:  Mr. Baugh argues that the government is

   4   going to assert a lack of remorse as a ground for imposition

   5   of the death penalty and argues that to deal with the issue of

   6   lack of remorse, which is as of the time the jury speaks,

   7   involves consideration of events subsequent to the bombing.

   8   What is your response to that?

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  And to the extent that his own lack

  10   of remorse, his mind-set is influenced by what he knows has

  11   happened after the bombing, he has that information.  If, for

  12   example, he -- it doesn't matter whether there are 12

  13   airplanes or 2,000 in Saudi Arabia as of today, it's his

  14   belief.  I don't think we need to go out and gather

  15   information he's unaware of, hand it to him and then have him

  16   say, now I'm truly not remorseful because I've learned more.

  17            If he believes that there are planes in Saudi Arabia

  18   and they have not left, and that's true, he has that

  19   information.  He knows that.  If he has a belief as to a

  20   number, he has that.  Whether it's accurate or not is
