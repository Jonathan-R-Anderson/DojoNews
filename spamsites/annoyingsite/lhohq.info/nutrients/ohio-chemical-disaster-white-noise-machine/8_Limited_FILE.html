<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  10            Now, Agent Mount, did you take photographs of various

  11   items while you were conducting your tests, your various

  12   forensic tests?

  13   A   Not that I remember.

  14   Q   Were you present when photographs were taken?

  15   A   No, not that I remember.

  16   Q   Did you examine any photographs ever in relation to the

  17   items that you tested?

  18   A   No.

  19   Q   I want to show you some photographs.

  20   A   Okay.

  21   Q   Some of which are in evidence and some that are not.

  22            This is the stack that's in evidence.  I won't repeat

  23   all the letters right now.  And this is the stack that's not.

  24   Tell me, please, if you recognize those items.

  25   A   I'd have to say some of these look familiar, but I don't



                                                                3783



   1   specifically remember each item individually.

   2   Q   Look at the ones that are not in evidence and tell me if

   3   you recognize them.

   4   A   Oh, okay.

   5            Again, I think I remember some of these, but I could

   6   not definitely tell you that I remember everything

   7   specifically.

   8   Q   Thank you.

   9            Now, when you were conducting your examinations, you

  10   in fact tested for the presence of trace amounts of TNT, PETN,

  11   and other explosives; is that correct?

  12   A   That's correct, yes.

  13   Q   When you were conducting your tests, Agent Mount, did you

  14   attempt to calibrate your machines so that you would be able

  15   to tell the amounts?

  16   A   No.  Again, we do calibrate the instruments, certainly.

  17   We conduct performance checks to make sure that they are

  18   working properly, but we do not do quantitative analysis for

  19   explosive residue work.  So, no, there were no calibrations

  20   that would tell us levels of explosives found.

  21   Q   But it is possible -- I'm sorry.  Were you finished with

  22   your answer?

  23   A   Yes.

  24   Q   It is in fact possible for you to do that, though?

  25   A   It would be possible with some of the instruments, yes.



                                                                3784



   1   Q   You could have taken it and set a control, right, and then

   2   use that as a measurement against the other items that you

   3   were testing; isn't that correct?

   4   A   I could have made some quantitative measurements.

   5   However, I think there are limitations with that, again, not

   6   knowing the starting materials, how much you have, what you

   7   are dealing with.

   8   Q   Did you in fact test all of the items at the same time?

   9   A   I believe that I did.  It was all one laboratory number,

  10   so, yes.

  11   Q   So you tested, for example, you tested K43 through K52 at

  12   the same time?

  13   A   All within the same day probably, sure.

  14   Q   And you also conducted a test on the residue --

  15   withdrawn -- on the vacuuming sample that was taken and

  16   transported to the lab; is that correct?

  17   A   Yes.

  18   Q   That was conducted on the same day?

  19   A   If we're talking about the vacuum samples, my K45 and K46,

  20   the Government Exhibits 533B and 533C, vacuum samples, yes.

  21   Q   Yes.

  22   A   Yes.

  23   Q   And you conducted a test of some pieces of paper; isn't

  24   that correct?

  25   A   That's correct.



                                                                3785



   1   Q   Where did those pieces of paper originally come from with

   2   respect to the items in the bag?

   3   A   I don't know.

   4   Q   Well, they --

   5   A   They were in a vial, if I remember correctly.

   6   Q   Isn't it a fact that they came out of the pockets of those

   7   black jeans?

   8   A   I'm not sure.  As received, they were in a separate vial.
