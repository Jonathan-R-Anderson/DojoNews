   8   name Wadih El Hage as the person.

   9            Skip a page to 364.  Again, this is dated November

  10   27, 1996 to ZTS Trading concerning a balance of the account

  11   that's being paid through a bank in Oregon.  And the next page

  12   indicates that it was prepared by Mr. Wadih El Hage.

  13            This completes this section now for this time.

  14            I ask that we turn to the Help Africa People section

  15   WEHX-W19.  I think the exhibit says W19.  Bring down so you

  16   can see a portion of the heading of Help Africa People that is

  17   cut off.  The W series also indicates that this was seized

  18   from, this is from the computer seized from Mr. El Hage's home

  19   that signifies WEH.com.

  20            This one is a letter concerning a multiple visa

  21   application on behalf of Mr. El Hage signed by H. Rodolf.  The

  22   next one K17 which also signifies that it came -- excuse me --

  23   the last one I apologize should not be W19.  It should be K19.

  24   This one is K17.  This concerns the minutes of the board of

  25   directors of Help Africa held in 1995 with the names Wadih El



                                                                4981



   1   Hage, Ahmad Younes and April Ray.

   2            I ask that we show the next one, which is K24 which

   3   is a letter dated November 27, the last year is not clear on

   4   this copy, to brother Mohammad Salman concerning request for

   5   donation signed by Wadih El Hage.  K37 is dated December 30,

   6   1995.  It is a document indicating the introduction and

   7   objective of Help Africa People and 38 which is not necessary

   8   to show is the second page of that.

   9            K40 through K -- excuse me K -- let us replace that.

  10   Let's skip to K15 which is a list of documents that was found

  11   in the computer.  It indicates number 2 is introduction to the

  12   agency.  Three is a letter to the CID about the Jax case, the

  13   minutes, other things including the malaria project, budget

  14   project, and other matters.  And if we turn to K20, K20

  15   through K23 is the description of the malaria project by Help

  16   Africa People in the Gedo region, and it includes statement of

  17   objectives, estimated number of beneficiaries, description of

  18   the target population group activity and justification.

  19            The second page talks about the costs of various

  20   items, as does the third page.  The third page also includes

  21   the account and the fourth page K23 gives a further

  22   explanation of the malaria control project.

  23            Your Honor, at this time actually I do need to

  24   approach your Honor to clarify some matters concerning the

  25   next exhibit.



                                                                4982



   1            THE COURT:  Can you defer that and take some others?

   2            MR. SCHMIDT:  I can do some others and then come back

   3   to that.

   4            THE COURT:  I'll see you.
