   1   Q.  So at the time at which you spoke to Mr. Mohamed you had

   2   quite a bit of information at your disposal, didn't you?

   3   A.  Yes, sir, I did.

   4   Q.  But you didn't tell him what information you had, right?

   5   A.  At what point do you mean?

   6   Q.  Well, did you say to him, for example, Harun tells us that

   7   he helped you get a passport?

   8   A.  I wouldn't tell him what another witness had told me.

   9   Q.  Right.  You would wait and see what he told you, right?

  10   A.  He was shown certain things.  I presume from the things in

  11   the items that we had shown him the documents and things that

  12   he knew we knew certain things.

  13   Q.  Right.  But you never told him the information you had

  14   from other witnesses, did you?

  15   A.  I wouldn't tell him that information, no.

  16   Q.  And you didn't tell him that information?

  17   A.  I did not.

  18   Q.  Now, while you were talking to him you were taking notes,

  19   right?
