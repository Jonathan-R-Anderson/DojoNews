<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">   7   Mr. Karas's summation, certain material that was shown to

   8   Mr. Al-'Owhali that caused him to confess, and I think what he

   9   said was pictures about Runda Estates and something about

  10   telephone numbers.  We searched the record both times and

  11   cannot find that.  If the government would favor us with a

  12   record reference, we won't make the motion that you instruct

  13   the jury that it never happened and that it be stricken.

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  We will do that.

  15            THE COURT:  Very well.  There was some other record

  16   inference?

  17            MR. WILFORD:  Yes, your Honor, page 5934.

  18            THE COURT:  What does it say?

  19            MR. WILFORD:  The portion of the transcript.

  20            MR. BAUGH:  Excuse me.  We are advised the

  21   translators cannot hear.

  22            MR. WILFORD:  We will speak loudly.

  23            THE COURT:  You can do that?

  24            MR. WILFORD:  Only when I have the microphone.  Your

  25   Honor, it's a portion of the transcript where Mr. Fitzgerald




                                                                6028


   1   is talking about an argument of Mr. Schmidt in terms of being

   2   a facilitator and what was needed to succeed as a facilitator.

   3   Then he goes on to say, particularly at line 12, Kherchtou

   4   explained it to you.  You don't have to shoot the gun if you

   5   are helping someone else you know is going to do it.  I think

   6   that is an oblique reference that Kherchtou pled guilty to the

   7   activities.

   8            THE COURT:  Overruled.

   9            MR. RICCO:  Your Honor, I might as well raise it

  10   since we are here.  I only have one point with respect to Mr.

  11   Fitzgerald's summation, and that was his explanation to the

  12   jury of what PETN is -- they can't hear?  My only objection is

  13   to what Mr. Fitzgerald said PETN is and how it was used in

  14   connection with this case.  He said it was only used in

  15   connection with detonator caps and explaining the role of

  16   Mohamed Odeh.  But the transcripts in the case said at page

  17   2483, the testimony of Kelly Mount, the question is, can you

  18   tell us whether or not PETN is a high explosive?  Answer, PETN

  19   is also a high explosive, yes.  Question, do you know what

  20   kind of use PETN is in connection with explosives?  Answer, it

  21   has several uses.  It may be found in blasting caps, it can be

  22   used in detonator coils, and it can be used as an explosive in

  23   and of itself.

  24       Maybe I misunderstood Mr. Fitzgerald.  Maybe he said it

  25   can be used for other purposes.  I didn't hear that and I




                                                                6029


   1   would like to have an opportunity to look at the record.  If

   2   he did say to be used in other connections, fine.  But if he

   3   is making a representation to the jury that the only way PETN

   4   is used, it's not mixed with TNT, I heard him say that, and it

   5   is only used for detonator caps, that is a mischaracterization

   6   of the record that should be corrected.

   7            THE COURT:  Why don't I take a recess, during which

   8   time we will do the distributions, and having consulted with

   9   the record we will take up these matters before the jury comes

  10   back in.

  11            (Recess)

  12            THE COURT:  With respect to the issue raised by Mr.

  13   Cohn, I understand reference to the record has satisfied you

  14   and the objection is withdrawn.

  15            MR. COHN:  The record reflects that a question about

  16   telephone numbers and the photos of the house was asked.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  On the other matter, Judge, I think

  18   it was fair argument to point out that with regard to the

  19   grinder in Dar es Salaam, first Kelly Mount said it could be

  20   used for a detonator and Mr. Ricco correctly described her

  21   testimony that you could use it for a detonator or an

  22   explosive.  In this case in Dar es Salaam, the grinder was

  23   tested and it had TNT but not PETN.  I think it is a fair

  24   conclusion to say that the PETN is used as a detonator.  I

  25   didn't say it was only used as a detonator and I think it is




                                                                6030


   1   fair argument on the evidence.

   2            MR. RICCO:  His statement on the record is that PETN

   3   is a detonator.  That's what he said.

   4            THE COURT:  I thought it was PETN is not ground.

   5   Isn't that the issue?

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  I also said it is a detonator.  If I

   7   misspoke, it is in a detonator.

   8            THE COURT:  What would you have me do?

   9            MR. RICCO:  I would have the court instruct the jury

  10   that there was testimony in this case that PETN is also a high

  11   explosive.  It can be used in detonating coils, it can be used

  12   as an explosive in and of itself, which is the testimony in

  13   this case.

  14            THE COURT:  But that would only be part of the story.

  15   The other part of the story is that PETN was not found on the

  16   grinder.

  17            MR. RICCO:  That's right.  PETN was also found in the

  18   room where the grinder was.  That's beside the point.  I am

  19   not raising it, your Honor, to connect it to the grinder.

  20            THE COURT:  You want the jury to be told that the

  21   testimony indicates that PETN may be used --

  22            MR. RICCO:  Judge, the testimony was PETN is also a

  23   high explosive.  It may be found in blasting caps.  It can be

  24   used --

  25            THE COURT:  Let's keep it very short and very simple.




                                                                6031


   1            MR. RICCO:  There was testimony that PETN is also a

   2   high explosive and it can be used in detonating --

   3            THE COURT:  Is a high explosive, it is also used in
