   1   to meet with Mr. Salim under the conditions you described in

   2   the recreation room, that is, without any restraints being

   3   placed on Mr. Salim.

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And in fact, on the morning of November 1, did you suggest

   6   that after you met in the computer room you move to the

   7   recreation room where it was more open?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  I would like to talk a little bit more about November 1.

  10   When your client left the room with Officer Pepe, you

  11   testified, I believe, that he was carrying that folder with

  12   his materials inside; is that correct?

  13   A.  He was carrying the folder.  I assume it had his materials

  14   inside.

  15   Q.  You didn't see any materials left in the room?

  16   A.  There might have been CDs left in the room.  I don't

  17   recall specifically.

  18   Q.  But he definitely took the -- was it a Redwell file?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  And he took that with him when he walked away with Officer

  21   Pepe?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  You mentioned that after a certain time after the officers

  24   entered 10 South, you saw a body you believed was your client

  25   being brought around to the front of the 10 South unit.




                                                                8305


   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Before that time, did officers or other staff enter that

   3   section of the unit and check the doors?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  You testified when you see this person being dragged on

   6   the floor --

   7   A.  Excuse me.  I am sorry, but I think I have to correct

   8   that.  There was a time, there were many times when officers

   9   checked, pulled on our door, and I saw them pull on other

  10   doors and I heard them pull on yet others, but I cannot say

  11   for certain whether that was before or after I first saw

  12   Mr. Salim being dragged to that area.

  13            MR. GARCIA:  If I may have a moment, your Honor.

  14   Q.  Mr. Adler, after this day, November 1, did there come a

  15   time that you again visited Mr. Salim before you were

  16   relieved?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  Do you remember approximately when that day was?

  19   A.  Within a day or two.

  20   Q.  Did you observe any injuries --

  21   A.  Maybe it was three or four, but within that period.

  22   Q.  Did you observe any injuries to Mr. Salim's face or eyes

  23   that would have been consistent with the blow you described?

  24   A.  No, I didn't.

  25   Q.  In fact, at that time did you come to doubt that it was




                                                                8306


   1   your client who had been on the floor in front of your cell?

   2   A.  I had doubts because I didn't see injuries consistent with

   3   what I had seen before, yes.

   4            MR. GARCIA:  I have nothing further.

   5            MR. RUHNKE:  Nothing further, your Honor.

   6            THE COURT:  Thank you.  You may step down.

   7            (Witness excused)

   8            THE COURT:  Defendant may call its next witness.
