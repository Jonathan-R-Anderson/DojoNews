   7   Q.  And that's where you first saw him, by the door at 10

   8   South?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Could you just generally describe his physical condition

  11   when you first saw him?

  12   A.  He had a foreign object in his left eye and he was

  13   bleeding all over from his nose, and he looked very disturbed,

  14   like he was standing with a lot of blood on his face.

  15   Q.  And did you at that time proceed any further into the back

  16   of the 10 South Unit?

  17   A.  No, sir.

  18   Q.  And what did you do after you saw Officer Pepe in this

  19   condition that you have just described for us, what did you do

  20   next?

  21   A.  I was asked by my supervisor, Mr. Kevin McDonald, to take

  22   Officer Pepe downstairs and give him whatever care is

  23   necessary at that time.

  24   Q.  And by downstairs, you mean the second floor of the

  25   facility?




                                                                7788


   1   A.  Yes, second floor where the hospital was, where other

   2   equipment is available like oxygen and IV fluids.

   3   Q.  And did you in fact then go to the second floor clinic?

   4   A.  Not with Officer Pepe.  Officer Pepe left before I could

   5   follow with him, because by the time I turned around, he was

   6   gone from the unit.

   7   Q.  Did there come a time later that morning that you saw

   8   Officer Pepe in the clinic area?

   9   A.  Yes, downstairs on the second floor in the urgent care

  10   room where we treat most of the immediately requiring

  11   attention-requiring people or inmates or staff members.

  12   Q.  And do you recall approximately how long after Officer

  13   Pepe left 10 South you left 10 South to go down to the clinic

  14   area?

  15   A.  Maybe about five or ten minutes.

  16   Q.  And could you describe for us what you saw Officer Pepe in

  17   the clinic area?  What was going on?

  18   A.  Officer Pepe was brought over to the emergency gurney,

  19   which we call -- it's a bed like stuff with wheels which we

  20   can take him out in case he is required to do it, and he was

  21   laid down.  My supervisor Dr. Glover was about to start an IV

  22   fluid line on him and some other staff members was trying to

  23   clean him up so that we could see where his injuries were.

  24            I was present behind Dr. Glover and Officer Pepe was

  25   on the gurney trying to be a little more impatient and trying




                                                                7789


   1   to be more getting restless.

   2   Q.  Did Officer Pepe make any statements at that time?

   3   A.  Yes.  He told me, since I know him for nine or ten years,

   4   he told me, I gave them a good fight.

   5   Q.  And you remember him saying that that day?

   6   A.  Yes, sir.

   7   Q.  And did there come a time you got the IV into Officer Pepe

   8   there?

   9   A.  Initially we got one IV into him and it happened so that
