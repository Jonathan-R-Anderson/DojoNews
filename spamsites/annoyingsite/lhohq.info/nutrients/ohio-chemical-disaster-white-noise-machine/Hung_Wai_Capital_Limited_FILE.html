  20            THE COURT:  What is it?  Dirt?

  21            JUROR:  It is on the chairs, Judge.

  22            THE COURT:  Why don't we take a recess and I will get

  23   the building maintenance to see what it is.

  24            (Recess)

   1   inconvenience.  It has all been dusted and checked, and it is

   2   just a further illustration of how difficult it is sometimes

   3   to know how long something is going to take.

   4            Mr. Fitzgerald.

   5            MR. FITZGERALD:  Thank you, Judge.  Returning to the

   6   stipulation marked Government's Exhibit 50, paragraph 7.  It

   7   is stipulated by the parties that Government's Exhibits 519A

   8   through 519C are true and accurate copies of the business

   9   records of the Eagle Travel agency in Mombasa, Kenya.  It is

  10   further stipulated that if called to testify, the employee at

  11   Eagle Travel who sold the tickets in the name of Abdull Bast

  12   Awadah, spelled A-B-D-U-L-L, capital B-A-S-T, capital

  13   A-W-A-D-A-H, and Fahid Masalam, F-A-H-I-D, M-A-S-A-L-A-M,

  14   would testify that both tickets were purchased by Fahad,

  15   F-A-H-A-D, Masalam, M-A-S-A-L-A-M, on August 3, 1998, in

  16   exchange for total payment of $936 cash.

  17            Government's Exhibits 519A through 519C may be

  18   admitted in evidence.

  19            Your Honor, I would offer 519A through C at this

  20   time.

  21            THE COURT:  Received.

  22            (Government's Exhibits 519A through 519C received in

  23   evidence)

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  At this time we would display

  25   Government's Exhibit 519A.

   1            THE COURT:  Stipulation 50 is already in evidence?

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.  Page 1, and just

   3   reading the name Fahid Masalam, F-A-H-I-D, M-A-S-A-L-A-M, and

   4   if we could display the fourth page of that exhibit, and the

   5   green card reads at the top M-S-A-L-A-M/F-A-H-I-D Mohamed,

   6   M-O-H-A-M-E-D, Ally, A-L-L-Y, Mister, M-R.  Underneath that,

   7   two lines down, it reads Awadah, A-W-A-D-A-H, with a slash

   8   mark, followed by Abdull Bast, A-B-D-U-L-L, B-A-S-T, followed

   9   by M-R for mister, and underneath that, next line says Y-E,

  10   and then P-P-T, and the number 00110161.  Beneath that, in the

  11   far column under C-A-R-R, it says P-K under F-L-T, 746 and

  12   then it says 6 August.

  13            Now turning to 519B, if we could display that on the

  14   screen, and focusing on the name on the top portion

  15   handwritten, Abdalla Ahmed, spelled A-B-D-A-L-L-A, separate

  16   word A-H-M-E-D, and the ticket below shows a route from

  17   Nairobi to Karachi, K-A-R-A-C-H-I, to Sanaa, S-A-N-A-A, and

  18   the date listed for Nairobi to Karachi is August 6 at the time

  19   of 1500.  And then the Karachi to Sanaa, S-A-N-A-A, leg is

  20   open.

  21            If we display the second page of that exhibit, and

  22   that is a card which reads Mr. Abdulla, A-B-D-U-L-L-A, Ahmed,
