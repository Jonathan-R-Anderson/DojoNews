<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  15            MR. COHN:  It does, because it's responsive sort of

  16   to your question, and that is this:  That an Allen charge

  17   traditionally says you should go back and try again because

  18   there's no reason to believe another jury won't come to the

  19   same conclusion.  Another jury can't come to the same

  20   conclusion.  It never gets to go to another jury, and

  21   therefore, an Allen charge will always be inappropriate.  And

  22   in my view, a deadlock notice is a verdict.

  23            THE COURT:  A deadlock --

  24            MR. COHN:  Is a verdict.

  25            THE COURT:  A deadlocked jury is a verdict because



                                                                6641



   1   the consequences of a deadlocked verdict are that the death

   2   sentence cannot be imposed.

   3            MR. COHN:  That's right.  That's my view and that's

   4   what a deadlock notice means.

   5            Secondly, if your Honor is not going to tell them in

   6   your preliminary charge the language about lack of unanimity,

   7   I ask that you reconsider your language on page 8 of your

   8   preliminary charge just below the typographical error that was

   9   corrected.  And after you look at it, I'll tell you why.

  10            THE COURT:  It's a statute.

  11            MR. COHN:  Yes, but it is technically correct, your

  12   Honor.  But in the context of what you are doing about not

  13   telling them that lack of unanimity will result in a verdict

  14   of life without parole, it misstates the spirit because it

  15   indicates the only way they get life without parole is by

  16   unanimity saying no death.  And while it does restate the

  17   statute and it is technically correct, it's only half the

  18   issue and creates a misimpression at this stage, which I think

  19   the jury ought not to have.

  20            So the answer is it's not incorrect.  I just think

  21   it's incomplete.  And given that you won't give the balancing

  22   language later on, you ought to reconsider how you do that.  I

  23   think that you can fairly tell the jury in place of this that

  24   a unanimous verdict for death will result in death and leave

  25   it alone.



                                                                6642



   1            THE COURT:  That's what I say.

   2            MR. COHN:  No, you don't.  You say a unanimous

   3   verdict for life -- what you say is if the jury is

   4   unanimous -- is not justified --

   5            THE COURT:  The second part of the language, "must be

   6   unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt before you consider

   7   imposition of the death sentence" on page 4.

   8            MR. COHN:  But here, your Honor, look on page 8,

   9   where it says --

  10            THE COURT:  Top of 3, with respect to both the

  11   Gateway and the statutory the jury is told that they must be

  12   unanimous and beyond a reasonable doubt before they can even

  13   consider it.

  14            MR. COHN:  Yes, that's right, Judge.  But now on page

  15   8 you are on balancing.

  16            THE COURT:  Yes.

  17            MR. COHN:  And you say, "and if after such balancing

  18   the jury unanimously determines that a sentence of death is

  19   not justified with regard to it, then he will be sentenced to

  20   life imprisonment."  And I suggest to you that, your Honor,

  21   that while that is correct in terms of the statute, a

  22   unanimous verdict, which I'm sure the Court would much prefer,

  23   would result in that, it is also true that the failure to

  24   reach a unanimous verdict that --

  25            THE COURT:  You would like that second sentence to



                                                                6643



   1   read, "If after such a verdict the jury does not unanimously

   2   determine that a sentence of death is justified, the law

   3   provides...," that's what you would like?

   4            MR. COHN:  I would like that, but I thought your

   5   Honor said you won't charge that in this document, and

   6   therefore -- and if I'm wrong, yes, that's what I would like

   7   it to say.

   8            THE COURT:  I could strike "unanimously."  It will

   9   not change the sentence.  It could read, "If after such a

  10   balance, the jury determines that a sentence of death is not

  11   justified."

  12            MR. COHN:  No, Judge, I think that doesn't meet it.

  13   If it's going to talk about a determination of what is

  14   justified, then it should say, "A jury determines that it is
