  18   ICP process, and she was able to determine, based on a

  19   chemical position, and you see the chart there, she could

  20   determine that there were at least 19 different cylinders used

  21   in the back of the truck.  Again, there is no video of the

  22   bombing, but imagine these flying around the vicinity on the

  23   morning of August 7.

  24            Next we move to July 28.  On July 28, Khalfan Khamis

  25   Mohamed gets a Yemeni visa for his passport.  Look at



                                                                5423



   1   Government's Exhibit 1451.  There you see Khalfan Khamis

   2   Mohamed's photo at the top of the application, and he doesn't

   3   apply for it in his own name but Zahran Nassor Maulid, the

   4   same name as the passport application found in 15 Amani.

   5   There you see additional information and he puts down his

   6   profession as businessman.

   1            MR. KARAS:  (Continuing) July 27 through July 30, we

   2   pull up Government Exhibit 594-27, and 594 is the minutes used

   3   on the satellite phone that we talked about yesterday, and

   4   between the 27th and 30th of July you see down there at the

   5   bottom, 27th through the 29th, there are eight calls to a

   6   number 994, which is the country code for Azerbaijan, the

   7   country we talked about yesterday -- at the top of this map

   8   here, just north of Iran -- and then you see the local number

   9   there is 6880488.  That is the number that you are going to

  10   see called on the eve of the bombing and the morning of the

  11   bombing.  And from that number, ladies and gentlemen, there

  12   are records from Azerbaijan that are going to show an

  13   operator-assisted call to The Grapevine in London, the place

  14   where the Scotland Yard officers found one piece, one page of

  15   the claim of responsibility about a month after the bombing.

  16            At the bottom of that page, you see a telephone call

  17   from the satellite phone on July 29th, 1998 to that number

  18   2084411, and the 4411 number is one of the three numbers that

  19   belongs to Khalid al Fawwaz.  Then if we go to Government

  20   Exhibit 593, these are some of the records from O'Gara

  21   Satellite Networks where Ziyad Khalil, the person who

  22   purchases the minutes, you see on July 30th, the day after the

  23   telephone call goes from the satellite phone to Khalid al

  24   Fawwaz, he's in such a rush he takes an old minutes order, he

  25   scratches out April 13th, he puts July 30th.
