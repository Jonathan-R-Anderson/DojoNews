<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">   7   defendant of that same offense if you find that he aided and

   8   abetted that other person's use or carrying of the destructive

   9   device.  To convict the defendant you are considering as an

  10   aider and abettor on Count 283 or 284, the government must

  11   establish that he aided and abetted another person's use or

  12   carrying of the destructive device during and in relation to

  13   the bombing of the United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya,

  14   Count 283, or in relation to the bombing of the United States

  15   Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Count 284.

  16            I caution you, however, that to convict the defendant

  17   as an aider and abettor it is not sufficient that you find him

  18   to have aided and abetted the underlying violent crime, that

  19   is, explosive destruction of federal property.

  20            The government may prove the defendant's commission

  21   of the crime charged in Count 283 or 284 by showing either he

  22   actually committed the crime himself or that he aided and

  23   abetted another person's commission of the crime.  It is not

  24   required that both be established, but neither may be

  25   established unless the government has proved the required



                                                                6200



   1   elements beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, with respect to

   2   Count 283, the government only alleges that defendant Odeh

   3   acted as an aider and abettor.  Therefore, you need not

   4   consider whether he personally used or carried a destructive

   5   device in connection with Count 5.

   6            The special verdict form for Counts 283 and 284

   7   appears on pages 41, 42 and 43, and they follow the pattern

   8   which we have used with respect to the preceding counts.

   9            Ladies and gentlemen, I have now completed my

  10   instructions to you concerning the substantive offenses of the

  11   indictment arising out of the embassy bombings in Kenya and

  12   Tanzania.  But before I move on to the third and final group

  13   of counts in the indictment, that is, the counts involving
