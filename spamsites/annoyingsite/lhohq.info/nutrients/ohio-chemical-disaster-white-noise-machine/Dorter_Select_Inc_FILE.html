  23            THE WITNESS:  Exactly.

  24            THE COURT:  What I am trying to find out is what your

  25   line of sight was, especially your line of sight of the floor.




                                                                7647


   1            THE WITNESS:  My line of sight, obviously it is clear

   2   from the diagram I certainly couldn't see anything around the

   3   corner sort of going toward the right of the diagram, but I

   4   became aware of the guards and the person who I thought was

   5   Mr. Salim once they rounded the corner because Mr. Salim was

   6   being dragged, once he cleared the corner, was actually being

   7   dragged in our direction, Mr. Adler's and I.  In fact, he was

   8   ultimately dragged beyond us.

   9            THE COURT:  You recall he was dragged, looking at

  10   this diagram, to the right or the left of the column, if you

  11   remember?

  12            THE WITNESS:  I, truly I don't for sure, but I think

  13   it was between the -- I think it was to the right of the

  14   column as we look at the diagram, but I'm not 100 percent sure

  15   of that.

  16            THE COURT:  Now, there is no exit, is there, as you

  17   go in that direction?

  18            THE WITNESS:  There is a door -- the answer is I'm

  19   certainly not aware of an exit, no.

  20            THE COURT:  Are there going to be any pictures or

  21   anything which is going to clarify this?

  22            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, if you like, I have a

  23   photograph here which I think could answer every question,

  24   which I will show to Mr. McAllister when the jury returns as

  25   an additional exhibit.




                                                                7648


   1            MR. GARCIA:  Your Honor, the government intends to

   2   offer the photo he is holding through the next witness.

   3            THE COURT:  Through the next witness?

   5   that at the present moment I have a number of questions as to
