   5               (Jury present)

   6               THE COURT:  Good morning.

   7               THE JURY:  Good morning.

   8               MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, what we

   9     propose to do at this point is to read to the

  10     jury a number of stipulations that have not

  11     previously been read to the jury.

  12               What I intend to do is not repeat the

  13     boilerplate language and introduce all of them.

  14     I will give the stipulation number before I

  15     read it and repeat it after it is read it so

  16     the record will be clear what those numbers

  17     are.

  18               The first is stipulation number 1,

  19     K.K.M. stip 1.

  20               Stipulated and agreed as follows:

  21               If called as a witness, a person

  22     expert in the Arabic language would testify

  23     that the Arabic-language documents seized from

  24     Cell No. 6 on the 10 South Unit of the

  25     Metropolitan Correctional Center on November 1,

   3     displaying a fluent command of the Arabic

   4     language and a level consistent with a native

   5     speaker of Arabic.

   6               And it's agreed that this stipulation

   7     may be received in evidence and that is

   8     stipulation number 1.
