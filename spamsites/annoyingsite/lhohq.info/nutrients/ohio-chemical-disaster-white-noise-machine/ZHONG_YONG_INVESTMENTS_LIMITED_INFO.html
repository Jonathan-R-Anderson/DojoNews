  25            Isn't it a fact that in October 1997 you were shown a



                                                                5657



   1   photograph of Mohammed Atef, also known to you as Abu Hafs --

   2   Masry.  And you were unable to identify the photograph?

   3   "A.  Yes.

   4   "Q.  That is because he looked different in the photograph

   5   than he looked when you saw when in the Sudan and Pakistan, is

   6   that correct?

   7   "A.  Yes, maybe the picture is not clear or like that.

   8   "Q.  In fact, lots of people's appearance are very different

   9   when they have the Islamic beard and dress than when they

  10   shave and wear western clothes; is that correct?

  11   "A.  Yes.

  12   "Q.  And sometimes it's very hard to know who that person is?

  13   "A.  Yes.

  14   "Q.  When they are photographed in different attire and

  15   different facial hair?

  16   "A.  Right."

  17            There was a stipulation entered into evidence that we

  18   didn't read to you, it's WEHX S10, where the government agrees

  19   that if called as a witness an agent of the United States

  20   Federal Bureau of Investigation would testify that on November

  21   14, 1998 Sekander Juma when showed a photograph of Wadih El

  22   Hage failed to identify Mr. El Hage from the photograph.

  23            Now, Mr. Juma, he might have been nervous.  Mr.

  24   Kherchtou has already been involved in cooperating with the

  25   government.  Mr. Al Fadl was cooperating with the government.



                                                                5658



   1   They were not on the witness stand.  They didn't fly from

   2   Jetta.  They didn't travel from California through Arizona.

   3   They were relaxed.  And they had problems making an

   4   identification.  The government asks you to put Mr. El Hage at

   5   a higher standard that than they put their own people.

   6            Mr. El Hage did not say he did not know the person.

   7   He said he did not know him as Abu Hafs -- excuse me -- as al

   8   Ban Shiri, and this goes back now to what I told you earlier

   9   about a different society, a different culture.

  10            As you sit here now you're probably saying:  He looks

  11   a little like him.  How did he not know?  Mr. Kherchtou said

  12   he cried.  Mr. Kherchtou knew him as both names.  Mr. El Hage

  13   knew him as Adel Habib.  So if Mr. El Hage said to Mr.

  14   Kherchtou that Adel Habib died in a ferry accident, Mr.

  15   Kherchtou would know, would understood that also means al Ban

  16   Shiri, but that doesn't prove that Mr. El Hage did.

  17            I ask you to put on page 467 -- excuse me -- of the

  18   expert, the Imam.  Do you have that 4687 and 88.  The Imam

  19   explains to you in that section that, in our religion it is

  20   better to let the guilty person go than punish an innocent, so

  21   if I make an assumption that I'm wrong along the line I was
