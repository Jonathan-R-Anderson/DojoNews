   6   I must say this, because I know that the --

   7            THE COURT:  I'm really trying to understand this.

   8            MR. BAUGH:  Can I explain --

   9            THE COURT:  You're not saying two wrongs make a

  10   right.

  11            MR. BAUGH:  No, your Honor, that's not my job.

  12            THE COURT:  And you're not saying --

  13            MR. BAUGH:  That would be justification.

  14            THE COURT:  And you're not saying that it is less

  15   shocking, to use a lay term, less shocking that the defendant

  16   caused the death of hundreds of innocent Kenyans because

  17   America in its actions with respect to Iraq also caused the

  18   death of countless people.  Is that the argument?

  19            MR. BAUGH:  Not quite.  If I might, your Honor, can I

  20   answer your question with a question?

  21            Let me ask the question you should ask of me, all

  22   right?  Mr. Baugh, under McVeigh how is this appropriate?  And

  23   here is the answer.  If Mr. Jones in the McVeigh trial instead

  24   of trying to prove motivation had tried to prove that the

  25   aggravator does not really amount to a valid aggravator, then


                  SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS (212) 805-0300
                                                                3527
       13T1BIN1


   1   this opinion in McVeigh wouldn't control.  McVeigh only limits

   2   evidence of motivation on a mitigator.  It does not limit, and

   3   in fact, they come out and say that he can rebut any issue

   4   that's raised.  McVeigh doesn't say that.

   5            So if you were to ask me that question, I would say,

   6   counsel for Mr. McVeigh, rather than alleging this as purely

   7   motivation, should have challenged the sufficiency of the

   8   aggravator, and I'm assuming they used the weapon of mass

   9   destruction as an aggravator.  I have not seen the death

  10   notice and I couldn't find it over the weekend.  If they had

  11   challenged the aggravator as sufficient, then it would have
