  12            The third statutory aggravating factor alleged by the

  13   government with regard to the capital counts is that the

  14   defendant committed the offenses under the particular counts

  15   after substantial planning and premeditation to cause the

  16   death of a person or to commit an act of terrorism.

  17            "Planning" means mentally formulating a method for

  18   doing something or achieving some end.

  19            "Substantial planning and premeditation" means a

  20   considerable or significant amount of planning and

  21   premeditation.

  22            An "act of terrorism" is an act calculated to

  23   influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation

  24   or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.

   2            "Premeditation" means thinking or deliberating about

   3   something and deciding whether to do it beforehand.

   4            To find that the government has satisfied its burden

   5   of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. al-'Owhali

   6   engaged in substantial planning and premeditation either to

   7   cause the death of a person or to commit an act of terrorism,

   8   you must unanimously agree on the particular object of the

   9   substantial planning and premeditation either to cause the

  10   death of a person, to commit an act of terrorism, or to do

  11   both.  Your finding as to this statutory aggravating factor

  12   must be indicated in the appropriate space in the Section II,

  13   Part A.3 of the Special Verdict Form.

  14            The fourth and final statutory aggravating factor

  15   alleged by the government with regard to the capital counts is

  16   that the defendant intentionally killed or attempted to kill

  17   more than one person in a single criminal episode.

  18            To establish the existence of this factor, the

  19   government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that

  20   Mr. al-'Owhali intentionally killed or attempted to kill more

  21   than one person in a single criminal episode.  You must

  22   unanimously agree on the particular actual or intended victims

  23   or a class of intended victims in order to find that this

  24   factor has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
