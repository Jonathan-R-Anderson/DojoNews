   7   officer that you saw on 10 South that morning prior to a

   8   startling event?

   9   A.  He was the only officer that I remember seeing, yes.

  10   Q.  Had you been on 10 South on numerous other occasions?

  11   A.  Many times.

  12   Q.  Were there numerous other occasions or not that Officer

  13   Pepe appeared to be the only officer on 10 South?

  14   A.  My recollection is that there were such occasions but they

  15   were not typical.

  16   Q.  When you were let into the 10 South unit, what occurred

  17   next?

  18   A.  I saw my cocounsel, Paul McAllister.

  19   Q.  Where do you see Mr. McAllister?

  20   A.  As you enter 10 South through a set of double doors,

  21   having entered through the second of the two doors, a few

  22   steps forward brings you to what I would call an officer's

  23   desk, and Mr. McAllister was standing by that desk.

  24            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, could we have displayed

  25   Government's Exhibit 4000 for Mr. Adler and for the jury.




                                                                8286


   1            THE COURT:  Yes.

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  Mr. Adler, just to orient you a bit, on the left-hand side

   4   of the diagram that you are looking at, that is the sally port

   5   or entranceway onto 10 South.  Do you see those double doors

   6   you were just describing?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  And the geometric object to the left, is that the

   9   officer's station that you were describing?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Directly in front of that there would be two rooms

  12   denominated attorney visit, inmate visit.  Starting from the

  13   top of the diagram, which room were you in?  Or which room did

  14   you see Mr. McAllister?

  15   A.  Can we correct this for witness age?  I will have to look

  16   a little more closely.

  17            I am sorry.  What is the question?

  18   Q.  Do you see four rooms from top to bottom, attorney visit,

  19   inmate visit?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  You said you saw Mr. McAllister in one of those rooms.

  22   Which room was he in?

  23   A.  No.  Actually I saw him in the area in front of all those

  24   rooms first, standing by the officers' station.

  25   Q.  Why don't you tell us what happened -- we will leave this




                                                                8287


   1   diagram up here.  What happened after you saw Mr. McAllister?

   2   Was there a conversation between you two?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  Had you seen Mr. Salim at that point?

   5   A.  No.

   6   Q.  Was there any conversation with Officer Pepe at that

   7   point?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  What was that conversation?

  10   A.  Officer Pepe said to both Mr. McAllister and me -- I think

  11   there had been previous conversation between Officer Pepe and

  12   Mr. McAllister -- that Mr. Salim is in prayer and he wanted,

  13   he, Mr. Pepe, Officer Pepe, wanted to allow Mr. Salim to

  14   finish his prayer before asking him again, which is why I

  15   thought there was previous conversation, whether he wanted to

  16   have an attorney visit that morning.

  17   Q.  Had there been times when you had gone to see Mr. Salim

  18   when he had refused to see you?

  19   A.  There had been some times, yes.

  20   Q.  What happened next?  Did Mr. Salim eventually come out

  21   into this area on 10 South?

  22   A.  He did, but there was further conversation before that

  23   happened.  Do you want to hear that?

  24   Q.  Yes.  What was that conversation?

  25   A.  Officer Pepe then went back apparently to speak to




                                                                8288


   1   Mr. Salim, returned, and said yes, he does want to see you,

   2   but he asks you to wait.  So we did.  Then a short time later,

   3   matter of minutes, three or four, Officer Pepe again returned

   4   from the direction of Mr. Salim's cell, and said he wants to

   5   use the computer.

   6   Q.  Stop there for a moment.

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Looking at the diagram on Government's Exhibit 4000, at

   9   that time, on November 1, 2000, was one of these rooms set up

  10   so that a PC or computer could be utilized?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  Do you recall anything about the computer setup?  For

  13   example, did it have a keyboard, did it have a mouse, did it

  14   have Internet access?

  15   A.  No, it had none of those things.  It was a monitor and a

  16   CD drive and a disk drive.

  17   Q.  Did Mr. Salim get taken into that computer room?  Is that

  18   what happened next?

  19   A.  There was some additional conversation with Officer Pepe.

  20   Q.  Tell us what that conversation was.

  21   A.  Officer Pepe said that he suggested to Mr. Salim, since he

  22   wanted to use the computer, that he would put him directly in

  23   the computer room, and I think he asked Mr. McAllister and me

  24   would we like to go into the room adjacent to it.  That is,

  25   the computer room is the uppermost room labeled attorney
