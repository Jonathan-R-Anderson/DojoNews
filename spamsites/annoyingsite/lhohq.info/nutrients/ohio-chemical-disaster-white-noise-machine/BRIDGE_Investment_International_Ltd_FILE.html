  15   tactics that would be unacceptable in the United States?

  16            MR. BUTLER:  Objection, your Honor.

  17            THE COURT:  Sustained.  Sustained.

  18   Q.  After having had that training, it never occurred to you

  19   to ask the Kenyans whether or not they were treating

  20   Mr. al-'Owhali decently?

  21            MR. BUTLER:  Objection, your Honor.

  22            THE COURT:  I'll allow that question.

  23   A.  My training in the military was for military

  24   interrogations.  In other words, if I was ever captured as an

  25   American fighting soldier by the enemy, not -- had nothing to



                                                                2120



   1   do with law enforcement interrogation.

   2   Q.  So you were confident, were you, that the Kenyan CID

   3   people were playing by the same rules that you were playing by

   4   because of mandative law?

   5            MR. BUTLER:  Objection.

   6            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   7            MR. COHN:  I have nothing further.

   8            THE COURT:  Mr. Ricco, on behalf of defendant Odeh.

   9   RECROSS-EXAMINATION

  10   BY MR. RICCO:

  11   Q.  I want to focus right in on Mr. Butler's questions about

  12   Mr. al-'Owhali not saying things.

  13   A.  Yes, sir.

  14   Q.  Okay.  Now, you asked Mr. al-'Owhali to describe to you

  15   the people who he knew were involved in the bombing, correct?

  16   A.  I don't remember exactly how the question came, sir, but I

  17   do remember us getting to a point where he told me "I'm not

  18   going ot tell you everything."  I remember that.

  19   Q.  Okay, I heard that.  Now I want to ask you about my

  20   question.

  21   A.  Yes, sir.

  22   Q.  And my question is about whether or not you asked

  23   Mr. al-'Owhali to describe to you the people that he knew was

  24   involved in the planning.

  25            Did that happen?



                                                                2121



   1   A.  I wanted to get all that information, yes, sir.

   2   Q.  Did that happen?

   3   A.  Yes, sir, I asked him.

   4   Q.  And what he said was, he described Azzam, right?

   5   A.  Yes, he did.

   6   Q.  And he described Azzam as the person who drove the truck,

   7   detonated the bomb at the United States Embassy, isn't that

   8   right?

   9   A.  Yes, he did.

  10   Q.  He described him as being 26 years old, approximately 170

  11   centimeters tall, weighing 80 kilograms, black hair and brown

  12   eyes, isn't that right?

  13   A.  I believe that's correct, sir.

  14   Q.  He described to you Saleh, right?

  15   A.  Yes, he did.

  16   Q.  He says Saleh was an Egyptian, and that he was the planner

  17   for both the U.S. Embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam and

  18   Nairobi, isn't that right?

  19   A.  That's correct, sir.

   1   Q.  He further described Saleh as being in his 30s, about five

   2   seven, medium build with black hair and brown eyes.  Isn't

   3   that right?

   4   A.  That's true, sir.

   5   Q.  You asked him to describe the fellow Harun, right?

   6   A.  Yes, I did.

   7   Q.  An he said Harun was a light-skinned black Somali-looking

   8   man who assisted in the planning of the bombing of the United

   9   States embassy in Nairobi and is further described as being

  10   about 24 years old, isn't that correct?

  11   A.  That sounds about right, sir.

  12   Q.  He said he was about five foot five, that he was skinny

  13   with short black hair and dark eyes, isn't that right?
