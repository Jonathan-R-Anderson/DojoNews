<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  24   submitted as Al-'Owhali Exhibit R.

  25            THE COURT:  Al-'Owhali Exhibit R.



                                                                7291



   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I believe it is R.  If

   2   we're going to reference the Al-'Owhali exhibit, which is a

   3   regulation, I think we should also reference the stipulation

   4   concerning the government's response to that regulation, which

   5   is 2281.

   6            THE COURT:  Why don't I say Al-'Owhali Exhibit R and

   7   stipulation --

   8            What's the number?

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  2281.

  10            THE COURT:  -- 2281 deal with these issues.

  11            Let me read it again:  As to the first non-statutory

  12   aggravating factor, the government contends that Al-'Owhali

  13   poses a continuing and serious threat even though he will be

  14   imprisoned for life.  Al-'Owhali denies that he constitutes

  15   such a threat and contends that he will be subject to rigorous

  16   security (the special administrative measures), and will,

  17   therefore, not constitute a threat.

  18            No, that's redundant.

  19            The government contends that, despite these measures,

  20   the threat will be present.  It is for you to decide whether

  21   defendant Al-'Owhali would or would not pose a continuing and

  22   serious threat.

  23            The special administrative measures are not

  24   automatically applied, but are applied in accordance with

  25   their provisions.  Al-'Owhali Exhibit R and Stipulation 2281



                                                                7292



   1   deal with these issues.

   2            Is that acceptable?

   3            MR. COHN:  Yes.

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

   5            THE COURT:  All right.  I will put that in legible

   6   form and we'll send it in to the jury.

   7            This has let us know exactly where they are in the

   8   Special Verdict Form.

   9            All right.  Maybe I could even get a scribe with

  10   clearer handwriting.  We'll await further word from the jury.

  11            MR. BAUGH:  Are you going to bring them out and read

  12   it to them, or are you going to send it back, or both?

  13            THE COURT:  I'm going to send it back.

  14            MR. BAUGH:  Okay.

  15            THE COURT:  Is that acceptable?  It takes ten minutes

  16   for them to come in and ten minutes for them to go back.

  17            (Recess pending verdict; time noted:  12:00 p.m.)
