<meta name="content" desription="In 1978–1981, the CDC conducted a hepatitis B vaccine experiment on homosexual men living in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles. HIV/AIDS was first detected among the participants in the CDC hepatitis B vaccine trial and quickly spread throughout the gay community in those cities. A body of evidence, including a detailed statistical analysis of the documented time line of when HIV infection was detected in the men’s blood and reported to the CDC. Dissidents who have studied the available published data are convinced that this ill-conceived experiment precipitated the devastating AIDS epidemic in America’s homosexual community. The gay men in the experiment were injected with a vaccine that had been made using human hepatitis B infected blood which was injected into chimpanzees known to be infected with the cancer causing simian virus 40 (SV40); the virus that had contaminated the polio vaccine.

Before these CDC experiments there were no reported cases of HIV or AIDS in America. The AIDS epidemic was officially declared by CDC in 1981, at the conclusion of the experiment. Yet, in the NEJM published report (1980) researchers proclaimed the vaccine “safe and incidence of side effects low,” and claimed a 96% success rate. They failed to mention the emergence of a new disease affecting some of the subjects.

The men in the Manhattan experiment had the highest rate of HIV ever recorded for that time period: 20% were discovered to be HIV-positive in 1980, and over 40% in 1984. In addition, a re-examination of the stored blood samples from an AIDS trial in NYC by epidemiologists at the National Cancer Institute in 1999, found that one out of five gay men (20%) tested positive for the new KS herpes-8 virus (Kaposi’s Sarcoma virus in 1982.

Before 1978 no stored blood anywhere in the US tested positive for either HIV or the Kaposi’s Sarcoma virus (which was not identified until 1994).

An extraordinary PBS taped interview (1987) with medical historian Edward Shorter and Dr. Maurice Hilleman, Merck’s foremost vaccine developer acknowledged that the polio vaccine (manufactured by Merck) had been contaminated with SV40. He also indicated the likelihood that SV40 is the source of AIDS: “I didn’t know we were importing AIDS.”

He nevertheless defended the contaminated vaccine stating: “it was good science at the time because that was what you did. You didn’t worry about these wild viruses…”
The taped interview was never aired for fear of liability; but it was submitted to the Library of Congress and in 2011 was posted on YouTube.

How did these two viruses of primate origin get into the gay male population to cause AIDS and a contagious form of cancer? Can the AIDS epidemic in the US can be traced directly to CDC’s experiments? Given the lethal nature of these two combined viruses, it is likely that many, if not most, of the men in the CDC experiment eventually died of AIDS. The actual number of AIDS deaths among the men in the experiment has never been revealed, nor have their medical records been studied. Efforts to obtain this information have been rebuffed invoking the “confidential” nature of the experiment to deny access.

CORRESPONDENCE SENT TO  MAHATMA GHANDI UNIVERSITY Clifford E Carnicom Jan 072006 An attempt has been made to send the following correspondence to Mahatma Gandhi University at the following address obtained at the India Study Center website :  mguty@md2vsnl.net.in.  A second email has been sent to announce that this correspondence is being made public.  Both emails have been returned with an unknown host error, and

correspondence has therefore not been completed.  In the interim until communication has been ensured, this communication is being made available to the public. To Godfrey Louis and Santosh Kumar from Clifford E Carnicom: This email muist be delivered to:  To Godfrey Louis and Santosh Kumar,  Please confirm that you receive this email and that this delivery has taken place. I have just read a report regarding your research at the university. This report is now at:  http://www.rense.com/general69/microbe.htm  I think that it is appropriate that I refer you to research that I have been involved in as a citizen for the the last 6-7 years. This research is at:  http://www.carnicom.com  Please pay attention to the numerous articles on the detection of aerosolized cellular structures in airborne samples. 
<p>
Best analysis thus far involves what appears to be a dessicated form of erythrocyte,and there may also be an association with stem cells.  My work is centered on a covert operation such that the flow of information on it in the United States is highly "managed." There may be a relationship between my research and yours.  I hope that you will take the time to investigate this topic, but it is thus far impossible to make any progress on it within the United States acting from a citizen capacity. I have also produced a documentary that may beworth viewing; it is available from the public domain at:  http://www.carnicom.com/doc2.htm  This is a managed and controlled topic of discussion in the United States. It must be assumed now in this country that communication on this topic is monitored.  I hope that you are able to make further progress. Thank you.

But the report is meeting with a shower of skepticism from scientists who say extraordinary claims require extraordinary proofand this one hasn't got it. The scientists agree on two  points, though. The things look like cells, at least  superficially. And no one is  sure what they are. "These particles have much similarity with biological cells though they are devoid of DNA," wrote Godfrey Louis and A. Santhosh Kumar of Mahatma Gandhi University in Kottayam, India, in the controversial paper.  "Are these cell-like particles a kind of alternate life from space?" The mystery began when the scarlet showers containing  the red specks hit parts of  India in 2001. Researchers  said the particles might be dust or a fungus, but it  remained unclear. The new paper includes a chemical analysis of the  particles, a description of their appearance under  microscopes and a survey of  where they fell. It assesses various explanations for them  and concludes that the  specks, which vaguely  resemble red blood cells, might have come from a

From 'amazing' to 'bullshit': New Scientist latest cover story on Kerala scientist's theory SONU JAIN Posted online: Tuesday, March 07, 2006 at 0202 hours IST NEW DELHI, MARCH 6: Did it shower alien life form in  Kerala when red rain fell over several districts in July  2001? Kerala scientist Godfrey Louis believes so. When  he first came up with this theory in 2003, it was  expected to die quickly but now an international journal,  Astrophysics and Space Science, has accepted his  paper. And New Scientist, in its latest issue, has a cover story 'It's raining aliens' in which it has spoken to several scientists on Louis's theory.
