...Does the Sudarium (Latin for face cloth), a companion relic,  authenticate the disputed Shroud of Turin?   While most readers are familiar with the better-known artifact,  fewer are aware of the Sudarium of Oviedo, Spain.   It is alleged to be the head section of the body wrappings,  the larger part being the Shroud.   While the history of the Shroud is fascinating,  the Sudarium’s past is no less colorful,  including Knights Templars, Moors, El Cid, saints,  bishops and others in a colorful cast of characters  beginning with its arrival in Spain in AD631....
EXPLORING THE ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION  OF THE HEBREW LANGUAGE
 By Harrell Rhome, M.Div., Ph.D.- 2009
....Hebrew is a most misunderstood linguistic topic.   Gerald Massey, Valentia Straiton and others tell us  that the most ancient form of the letters originally  came from Egyptian hieroglyphs as the  Hebrew/Habiru were a wandering Egypto-Semitic tribe.   Godfrey Higgins’ Anacalypsis tells us the people  and the language first arose in ancient India  (the Oude tribe), later migrating to Egypt  and other lands.   Regardless of its earliest beginnings,  the later forms of Hebrew definitely have other origins...
WHAT WAS THE ANCIENT 
HEBREW RELIGION?
By Harrell Rhome, M.Div., Ph.D.
  This is excerpted from my unpublished manuscript  entitled From The Temple To The Talmud, a book  exploring the history and origins of Judaic traditions.   Early on in the project, before moving directly into  the Talmudic texts, I saw the need to answer  basic questions as to the actual nature of the religion  portrayed in the Old Testament.  This is a project  in biblical revisionism that is crucial in several ways.   First of all, it is important to know the truth about  a period of the ancient past which still impacts us today.   Secondly, the Old Testament bible stories are declared  to be actual history as well as divinely inspired literature,  from God himself, no less...

most intricate question, but with the advice and assistance of a
commission appointed for that purpose, they began the formulation of a
new banking law, affording a flexible currency, bottomed largely upon
commercial assets, the real wealth of the nation, instead of upon debt,
as formerly.

This measure was based upon the English, French and German plans, its
authors taking the best from each and making the whole conform to
American needs and conditions. Dru regarded this as one of his most
pressing reforms, for he hoped that it would not only prevent panics, as

credit trust, the greatest, the most far reaching and, under evil
direction, the most pernicious trust of all.

While in this connection, as well as all others, he was insistent that
business should be honestly conducted, yet it was his purpose to throw
all possible safeguards around it. In the past it had been not only
harassed by a monetary system that was a mere patchwork affair and
entirely inadequate to the needs of the times, but it had been
constantly threatened by tariff, railroad and other legislation
calculated to cause continued disturbance. The ever-present demagogue
had added to the confusion, and, altogether, legitimate business had
suffered more during the long season of unrest than had the law-defying
monopolies.

Led by the Federal Reserve, they replaced incentives for reckless speculation with catalysts for old-fashioned credit creation backed by levels of capital that are unprecedented in modern times.”

Winkler’s column was an egregious coverup of the “reckless speculation” that continued on steroids on Wall Street. The megabanks were trading their own stock in their own dark pools – which continues to this day. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would report that as of March 31, 2016, just four banks held 91 percent of $192.9 trillion in notional derivatives held by all banks and savings associations in the U.S. Those four banks were JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup’s Citibank (which blew itself up with derivatives in 2008), Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and Bank of America – the same banks that were taking giant sums from the Fed’s emergency repo loan facility in 2019.

Also in 2016, Michael Bloomberg showed very poor judgement in co-authoring an OpEd with Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, a man who should have been the target of investigative reporting by Bloomberg journalists for an unprecedented crime spree at his bank.

In 2015 Politico’s Luke O’Brien deeply reported the details of a Bloomberg News article that was critical on China and appeared to have been spiked to preserve business sales of the Bloomberg terminal in that country.

And then there are those strange associations with felony counts or fines at Wall Street banks and those expensive Bloomberg terminals. The chat rooms that facilitated the rigging of the Libor interest rate benchmark and the criminal charges that came out of the rigging of foreign exchange trading were tied to chat rooms on the Bloomberg terminals. According to the late Bloomberg reporter, Mark Pittman, the Bloomberg terminal also had the capability of allowing hedge funds to find the worst subprime dreck in the market, making it possible for hedge funds like John Paulson’s to short the market while getting banks like Goldman Sachs to sell the other side of the deal to its unwitting investors.

On November 20, 2019, Brian Chappatta, who still works for Bloomberg News, wrote this about the Fed’s emergency repo loans under the headline “Fed Throws the K
