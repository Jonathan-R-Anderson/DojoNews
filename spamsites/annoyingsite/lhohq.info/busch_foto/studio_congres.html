The Herbicide Threat
One of the most controversial aspects of Plan Colombia is the requirement for the Colombian Government to carry out fumigation programs in an effort to eliminate illegal coca cultivations. Along with chemical herbicides, one of the primary weapons used in these aerial spraying efforts is the fungal herbicide Fusarium oxysporum. Although Fusarium fumigation is touted by herbicidal suppliers and the U.S. Department of State as an economically efficient and environmentally sound method of combating drugs, the reality of Fusarium usage conflicts sharply with any claims of its safety and effectiveness. A recent article in the Washington Post describes massive food crop damage and river poisonings in Colombia's southern department of Putumayo. The mayor of La Hormiga, a municipality located in the heart of Putumayo, predicts widespread hunger in the town of 30,000 as a direct result of spraying. Reports like these are not uncommon or even surprising. When the history and scientific study of Fusarium fumigation is considered, the consequences of its mass usage in any environment become quite predictable.
History
The U.S. government first became interested in Fusarium in the 1960s after the fungus was found to be the causative factor of a blight that destroyed coca populations in Hawaii. As a response to growing cocaine use in the U.S., government agencies along with other researchers began to develop methods of mass production and field application of Fusarium. Efforts were also made to develop new strains and isolate phytotoxins for use against other narcotic plants.
In the early 90s, a Fusarium epidemic spread through coca fields of the Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru. In 1993, during a visit by a U.S. sponsored human rights delegation to the Huallaga valley, delegates were assailed with numerous accounts of US DEA planes spraying the fungus over coca fields. Although it is difficult to prove U.S. involvement with any certainty, the effects of the Fusarium outbreaks in Peru are clear. As the disease spread through the valley, the U.S. embassy reported that Fusarium was not specific to coca and was destroying a wide range of other plant species including food crops. Moreover, after the initial onslaught of the epidemic, the fungus appeared to have drastic long-term effects on the soil, making it difficult to replant crops. As a result, 3,000 peasant families were forced to find other methods of subsistence. Many farmers were forced to move deeper into the forest to secure uncontaminated land for crops. In 1999, Jim McDonough, the new Director of Florida's Office of Drug Control, lobbied for use of a strain of Fusarium to combat illegal marijuana cultivations. The idea was rescinded due to various health and environmental concerns raised by the press, Florida Citizens, and other government agencies, including the Florida Departments of Environment and Agriculture.
Non-specificity
As was evident during the Huallaga Valley epidemic, Fusarium is not host specific to coca and is very unstable in the natural environment. U.S. government studies in Peru showed that the fungus was killing many other plants including tomato, achiote, and papaya. Further studies by the International Institute of Biological Control provided similar conclusions - Fusarium was linked to stress and death of various experimental plant species. Still, many U.S. scientists maintain that the EN-4 strain currently used in Colombia is specific to plants in the genus Erythroxylum, which includes coca (not a very reassuring claim considering that over 200 other plant species are included in this genus, many of which are located in Colombia).šš However, many Colombians have seen the evidence of Fusarium's non-specificity first-hand. A few years back, a strain of the fungus ravaged flower growers in the area near Bogota, producing effects similar to those observed in Peru.
