<a href="../container/how_to_steal_an_election.html"><img src="smoke_xxx_chemtrail.gif" width="410" height="410" align="right" border="3" alt="how to steal an election"></a>



(4) Annually review their civilian inmate labor programs against the key management controls identified in appendix D. (5) Report all contacts with State or local corrections system on possible use of civilian inmate labor, facilities, land, or installation through command channels to Headquarters, Installation Management Activity (SFIM­PL), 2511 Jefferson Davis Highway, Taylor Building, Arlington, VA 22202­3926. 1­5. Civilian inmate labor programs a. Civilian inmate labor programs benefit both the Army and corrections systems by (1) Providing a source of labor at no direct labor cost to Army installations to accomplish tasks that would not be possible otherwise due to the manning and funding constraints under which the Army operates. (2) Providing meaningful work for inmates and, in some cases, additional space to alleviate overcrowding in nearby corrections facilities. (3) Making cost­effective use of buildings and land not otherwise being used. b. Except for the 3 exceptions listed in paragraph 2­1d below, installation civilian inmate labor programs may use civilian inmate labor only from Federal corrections facilities located either off or on the installation. c. Keys to operating an effective civilian inmate labor program on Army installations include (1) Establishing a comprehensive lease agreement, interservice, interagency, and/or 


<a href="../cinema/laughing_horses_orifice_headquarters_cinema_video.html">interdepartmental support agreement</a>



 (ISA), and/or memoranda of agreement with the corrections facility. (2) Developing a cooperative working relationship between installation personnel and corrections facility personnel. (3) Working closely with installation government employee labor unions to ensure union leaders understand the program and have current information on program status. (4) Training all installation personnel involved in the operation or administration of the program frequently. (5) Developing a public affairs plan informing the installation and the surrounding local community of the program and work projects assigned to civilian inmate labor. 1­6. The process Figure 1­1 diagrams the Army Civilian Inmate Labor Program process. The flowchart reads top dublic affairs plan that informs the installation and the surrounding local community of the program and work projects assigned to civilian inmate labor. This will largely mitigate potential negative repercussions from using and having inmates present on the installation. Press releases involving inmates will be issued only by the corrections facility, in coordination with the installation public affairs office, as corrections facility officials are responsible for protecting the privacy and other rights of inmates. Press releases regarding the civilian inmate labor program should be coordinated with the corrections facility superintendent. One copy of the press release will be routed through command channels to HQDA, Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management, Plans and Operations Division (DAIMMD), and HQDA, Office of the Chief of Public Affairs, Public Communications Division (SAPAPCD). Press releases do not require HQDA approval prior to release. (1) Media representatives should not be allowed to interview inmates nor take photographs of inmates without the corrections facility's and installation public affairs office specific approval. (2) Requests for interviews or photographs of inmates should be referred to the corrections facility superintendent and the installation public affairs office. 2­4. Procedures for establishing installation civilian inmate labor programs Procedures for establishing installation civilian inmate labor programs apply to both off­post corrections facilities and on­post civilian inmate prison camps. a. Upon finalizing negotiations with the corrections facility, the installation commander and corrections facility superintendent will prepare a proposed memorandum of agreement, using the format at appendix B, covering all aspects of the Civilian Inmate Labor Program under consideration. This agreement will include, but is not limited to, the governing provisions in paragraph 2­3, above. In addition, the memoranda of agreement must include provisions for reporting serious incidents and negative media coverage, addressed in paragraphs 4­1 and 4­2, and the projected cost avoidance from using civilian inmates addressed in paragraph 4­3, below. b. Installations will prepare an Inmate Labor Plan governing administration and operation of the inmate labor program on the installation. This plan will include, but is not limited to, procedures for assigning inmate labor details, oversight and/or monitoring responsibilities, procedures for requesting inmate labor details, training of personnel involved with the program, required security and/or safety measures, environmental considerations, and any installation reporting requirements. Inmate Labor Plan format is determined locally. c. Memoranda of agreement and/or Inmate Labor Plans will be reviewed as needed by the installation commander and corrections facility superintendent to incorporate changes in Army Civilian Inmate Labor Program policy and other factors affecting the terms and conditions of these documents. 
1­3. Explanation of abbreviations and terms Abbreviations and special terms used in this regulation are explained in the glossary. 1­4. Responsibilities a. The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations and Environment) (ASA(I&E)) will (1) Provide policy guidance and resolve policy issues. (2) Provide overall program direction.

AAAAA

3D-iD  - A Local Positioning System (LPS) that is capable of determining the 3-D location of items (and persons) within a 3-dimensional indoor, or otherwise bounded, space.  The system consists of inexpensive physical devices, called 'tags' associated with people or assets to be tracked, and an infrastructure for tracking the location of each tag.  [10:2657]  NOTE: Related technology applications include EAS, EHAM, GPS, IRID, and RFID.

ABSORPTION - (RF propagation) The irreversible conversion of the energy of an electromagnetic WAVE into another form of energy as a result of its interaction with matter. See also ELECTRO-OPTIC PAINTING and RADAR CAMOUFLAGE. [3]

ABSORPTION HIDING - A LOW-PROBABILITY-OF-INTERCEPT technique in which the radar operates in the ABSORPTION regions of the MILLIMETER WAVE spectrum (i.e., frequencies having large values of atmospheric attenuation by oxygen and water vapor), making it difficult to detect. [4:15] 

ABSORPTIVE CHAFF - CONFUSION REFLECTORS which consist of extremely thin conductors, graphite strands, or other material which will absorb electromagnetic energy.  See also CHAFF. [8]

ACOUSTIC BULLET - A NONLETHAL WEAPON consisting of a high-power, very low frequency acoustic beam weapon that incapacitates by creating plasma in form to the target, generating an impact wave like that of a blunt object. It causes blunt object trauma, as opposed to that of a conventional bullet which cause ripping and tearing of the target.  [10:2341]   See also SONIC BULLET.

ACOUSTIC INTELLIGENCE (ACINT or ACOUSTINT) - Intelligence derived from the collection and processing of acoustic phenomena.  [DoD]  NOTE:  Acoustic Intelligence is a component of MEASUREMENT AND SIGNATURE INTELLIGENCE (MASINT).

ACOUSTICS SIGNATURE CONTROL - The employment of materials, electronics, and platform design features intended to reduce the susceptibility of the platform to detection, tracking, and engagement by an adversary using acoustic sensors, such as SONAR.   ACOUSTICS SIGNATURE CONTROL includes the use of passive and active devices, materials, features, or techniques on a platform to reduce or limit the generation or transmission of sound or vibrations.  These include specially designed materials, coatings, absorbers, decouplers or damping, as well as active noise reduction or cancellation systems, and magnetic bearings.  [12]  See also INFRARED SIGNATURE CONTROL, LASER SIGNATURE CONTROL, MAGNETIC SIGNATURE CONTROL, MULTISPECTRAL SIGNATURE CONTROL, OPTICAL SIGNATURE CONTROL, RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) SIGNATURE CONTROL, and SIGNATURE CONTROL.

ACOUSTIC WEAPON - A device, which may or may not be a NONLETHAL WEAPON, that emits sonic frequencies causing such sensations as debilitating dizziness and motion sickness or nausea, and can also generate vibrations of body organs resulting in extreme pain, seizures, or death.  [10:2730]   See also HIGH POWERED ACOUSTIC WEAPON, SILENT SOUND DEVICE, THERMAL GUN.   Note: Acoustic weapons may be grouped as shown below:  [10:2748]

ACOUSTIC WEAPON CHARACTERISTICS    
TYPE    FREQUENCY     TARGET EFFECTS    PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS    
Infrasound    Less than 20 Hz    Mild to severe discomfort; organ functional disturbance; organ disruption    Ground or structure penetration   Long-range propagation  Non-directional    
Sonic    20 Hz to 20 KHz    Hearing interference; performance degradation; pain; hearing loss; tissue damage    Moderate propagation and moderate directionality    
Ultrasonic    20 KHz and above    Possible diffuse psychological effects; pain; surface tissue damage; tissue destruction    Limited propagation; highly directional    

ACOUSTO-OPTIC (AO) RECEIVER - A SIGINT receiver which process signals using BRAGG CELLs.  In these cells, RF signals are converted into acoustic waves which are then sampled with light beams.  AO receivers share the positive features of MICROSCAN RECEIVERs, and have good signal probability of intercept (POI).  [10:2561]

ACOUSTO-OPTICS - The interaction between sound and light in a crystal. This interaction modifies the light beam's amplitude, frequency, phase and direction, thus processing and revealing information carried by both the sound and the light. Acousto-optics has application in ESM for analysis of low-probability-of-intercept FREQUENCY HOPPING signals. See also BRAGG CELL. [10:29] NOTE: In a typical application, a laser beam is expanded, spatially filtered, and collimated by a set of lenses which direct the beam to a Bragg cell. Concurrently, a transducer on the cell converts the micro-wave signal into an acoustic wave that modulates the light beam, producing a separate beam for each component frequency of the signal and deflecting the beam in proportion to its frequency. A photodetector array detects each beam's position (its underlying frequency), and produces electric output indicating both the frequency and power of each component in the original microwave signal. This rapid signal processing allows accurate measurement of the signal's pulse timing and duration.

ACTIVE DENIAL SYSTEM - A NONLETHAL WEAPON (NLW) that uses pulses of electromagnetic energy to heat the water molecules in a person's skin, causing a painful burning sensation but no actual burning.  [10:2883]  NOTE:  The ACTIVE DENIAL SYSTEM is designed to disperse disruptive crowds as far as 640 meters away without injuring the demonstrators.  The radiation can penetrate clothing but will only react with skin to a depth of less than 0.4 mm.   These weapons can be either hand-held, vehicle mounted, or mounted on aircraft.

ACTIVE ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES - The employment of active ELECTRONIC JAMMING to prevent or degrade the use of the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM by the enemy. Contrast with PASSIVE ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES. [10:3]

ACTIVE INFRARED SENSOR - An INFRARED sensor which transmits and receives radiation. The sensor may be a COHERENT INFRARED SENSOR or an INCOHERENT INFRARED SENSOR. Contrast with PASSIVE INFRARED SENSOR. [4:6]

ADVANCED MULTI-FUNCTION RADIO FREQUENCY SYSTEM (AMRFS) - A system which consolidates, in a single aperture, the antennas required for shipboard radar, ELECTRONIC WARFARE (EW), IDENTIFICATION, FRIEND OR FOE (IFF) and communications.  [10:2678]

AEROSOL - (1) (laser-maser) A suspension of small solid or liquid particles in a gaseous medium. Typically, the particle sizes may range from 100 micrometers to 0.01 micrometers or less. [3] (2) Solid, resonant-size particles dispersed in the atmosphere, and having a high index of refraction. The particles both scatter and absorb visual and laser energy so as to reduce the effectiveness of weapon systems directed by these techniques. [4:1] NOTE: The particle size and type are chosen to scatter or absorb radiation from electro-optical system targets. Some forms of aerosols can partially absorb microwave signals. [8]

AIRBORNE LASER (ABL) - A DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPON (DEW) designed to deliver a lethal LASER beam onto a ballistic missile during the highly vulnerable boost phase of flight.  The system autonomously will detect and locate a missile seconds after launch using a series of INFRARED sensors that work in tandem to target the missiles.  [10:2589]  The ABL consists of three critical laser systems linked by mirrors.  The primary mirror both gathers in light beams and focuses them outward; other mirrors reflect the laser beams, split them, sometimes into two separate beams of different wavelengths (diachronic mirrors), steer them, and, for the killing beam, shape its wave front.  A megawatt  CHEMICAL OXYGEN IODINE LASER (COIL) is the primary killing beam. [10:2607]  See also BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE (BMD).

ALL-GAS CHEMICAL LASER - A CHEMICAL LASER which creates its light by combining two specific gases: nitrogen chloride and atomic iodine.   The device is expected to be relatively light in weight, operate in zero-gravity environments and possess a built-in heat rejection exhaust.  [10:2854]

AMIABILITY AGENT - A NONLETHAL WEAPON consisting of an agent which causes those with whom it comes in contact to become very easily persuadable.  [10:2751]

ANESTHETICS - As used in NONLETHAL WEAPONs - tranquilizers, dispensed with gas or darts, that could put people to sleep.  [10:2857]

ANTENNA - That part of a transmitting or receiving system that is designed to radiate or to receive electromagnetic waves.  [3]  NOTE:   Antennas are characterized by coverage (non-directional or directional), Gain (generally in decibels), Frequency Range, POLARIZATION (linear or circular), BANDWIDTH (narrow or wide), and type.  There are many types of antennas.  The table below lists some antenna types.  [10:2688]

ANTIMATTER PARTICLE BEAM (APB) - A DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPON (DEW) under DoD's WEAPONS SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES (WST).  The generation, propagation and control of antimatter beams of hydrogen or its isotopes.   Interaction of the APB with a target consisting of normal matter results in complete annihilation of the beam and an equal amount of normal matter in the target.  [www.dtic.mil]  NOTE:  APBs must be charged to be accelerated, but exoatmospheric beams must be neutralized so that the repulsion of like-charged particles will not spread the beam to a noneffective power density before it reaches the target.  APBs potentially have only exoatmospheric, or space, applications because the atmosphere wuld erode them significantly. See also CHARGED PARTICLE BEAM (CPB), GAMMA-RAY LASER (GRASER), HIGH POWER MICROWAVE/RADIO FREQUENCY (HPM/RF), KINETIC ENERGY WEAPON (KEW) and NEUTRAL PARTICLE BEAM (NPB).

ANTI-PERSONNEL BEAM WEAPON (APBW) - A  NONLETHAL WEAPON LASER device, similar to the TASER, designed to stun a person or freeze him in his tracks.  In place of the TASER's wires to carry the stun charge, the APBW employs two ultraviolet light laser beam  to create two charged channels of ionized air that carry the disabling electrical current for a distance of up to 100 meters.  [10:2952]  See also VEHICLE-DISABLING WEAPON (VDW).  NOTE:  It is claimed that while the APBW current had a repetition rate sufficiently rapid to tetanize ( Tetanization is the stimulation of muscles fibers at a frequency which merges their individual contractions into a single sustained contraction. ) muscle tissue, it is insufficient to affect the muscles of the heart and diaphragm.  In addition, the APBW will not incur retinal damage because the cornea absorbs all the ultraviolet radiation at the wavelengths used.  Moreover, the beams are too weak to produce photokeratis ( corneal inflammation ) unless they are directed at the eyes for several minutes.  

ANTIREFLECTION OVERCOAT - A coating of material, such as poly-tetrafluoroethylene, which reduces the reflectance of a material at infrared wavelengths. [10:4] See also RADAR CAMOUFLAGE.

[10:2754]  A Teflon-type environmentally neutral lubricant that make footholds or traction exceedingly difficult.   In this application, the product can be used to deny access to areas or cover a unit's flank.  [10:2857]
ARMOR MATERIALS - That category of MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY  which addresses materials specifically designed to protect equipment and personnel from enemy threats.  Armor materials include metals and related composites (e.g., titanium diboride), ceramics and related composites (e.g., crystal whiskers in a bonded matrix), organic fibers and composites (e.g., arrays of woven cloth), and layered combinations of these.  [12]

AUTONOMOUS TARGET RECOGNITION (ATR) - The ability of a weapon to locate and engage a target without data updates or guidance from external sources.  ATR involves automated high speed signal or imaging processing, rapid data base management and high fidelity classification and correlation.   Contrast with MAN-IN-THE-LOOP SYSTEMS.  See also BRILLIANT AMMUNITION, SMART WEAPON.  [10:31] NOTE: There are three primary components of ATR: algorithms, processors, and sensor technology.

BEAMWIDTH (BEAM WIDTH) - The angle between the directions, on either side of the axis, at which the intensity of the radio frequency field drops to one-half the value it has on the axis. [1] Synonymous with half-power beam width. See also BEAM DIAMETER. 

BEAN BAG BATON - A NONLETHAL WEAPON consisting of an aluminum baton which utilizes an air cartridge to fire a bean bag filled with lead shot at 300 ft/sec.  [10:2745]

BEEPS AND SQUEAKS - A tongue-in- cheek reference to ELECTRONIC WARFARE. [] 

BEHAVIORAL BIOMETRICS - BIOMETRICS which include voiceprints, handwritten signatures and key stroke/signature dynamics.  [10:2622]

BINARY-PHASE-CODED CONTINUOUS-WAVE RADAR - A LOW PROBABILITY-OF-INTERCEPT (LPI) RADAR which has a PSEUDORANDOM phase-coded MODULATION on a transmitted CONTINUOUS-WAVE (CW) SIGNAL.  [10:2859]

BIOMETRIC DEVICE - A device which identifies people through unique body characteristics. [] NOTE: Biometric devices include those which can identify hand-geometry, fingerprints, retinal patterns, signatures, and voice-prints. 

BIOMETRICS - The automatic identification of a person based on his/her physiological or behavioral characteristics.  Refer to the table below for a list of biometric technologies . Biometrics fall into two categories: PHYSIOLOGICAL BIOMETRICS and BEHAVIORAL BIOMETRICS.  [10:2622]  NOTE: (1) The person to be identified is required to be physically present at the point-of-identification.

BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES    
Dynamic Signature Verification (DSV)    
Face Geometry    
Finger Scan

[10:2592] NOTE: An example includes genetically engineered high-strength silk fibers.  These fibers, which are about 5 microns in diameter, are 100-percent tougher than Kevlar aramid fibers.   See also NANOSCIENCE

BIORADAR - A RADAR device which helps in searches for buried persons.  It can measure heart frequency and breathing up to 3 meters under snow and rubble.  It can also detect persons in buildings from the outside, even through stone walls up to 6 meters thick.

BLACK PROGRAM - A highly classified weapon system acquisition program, generally requiring special security clearances and facilities for contractors and others involved with the program.

BLINDING LASER - A NONLETHAL WARFARE weapon consisting of a laser intended to overload, destroy or degrade optics or target-acquisition electronics from the air, sea or land.  [10:2648]  See also ANTI-AIR LASER.

BOLO - A NONLETHAL WEAPON consisting of a shotgun round holding three rubber projectiles connected by 5.5 foot high-strength cords.  The bolo is designed for use against fleeing target individuals, where a target hit by any of the balls will cause the other balls to wrap the cord around the legs of the individual.

BOUNDING NON-LETHAL MUNITION (BNLM) - A NONLETHAL WEAPON tactical area denial munition for site security and perimeter defense.  The payloads produce an audible alert signal to friendly forces within a range of 200 meters.  [10:2857]

BRAGG CELL - A thin slab of transparent crystal (such as tellurium oxide) with one or more piezoelectric transducers attached. A microwave signal excites the transducer to create a sound wave in the crystal at the microwave's frequency. The PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT generated by the sound wave changes the crystal's optical index of refraction, also at the microwave frequency. These changes in the optical index diffract a portion of the incident light beam so that two beams emerge from the crystal - an un-diffracted beam exiting at the angle of entry, and a diffracted beam exiting at an angle proportional the frequency of the sound wave. [10:29*] See also ACOUSTO-OPTICS.

BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE (BCI) - A system which allows the user to interact with a VIRTUAL-REALITY environment using brain waves.

BREAK LOCK - In a TERMINAL DEFENSE situation: The condition where a homing sensor or fuze loses the target which it has had a lock-on. If so configured, the sensor will revert to a search mode to regain a lock-on its target. Contrast with BREAK TRACK.

BREAK TRACK - In a situation other than TERMINAL DEFENSE: The condition where a tracking or acquisition sensor loses the target which it has been tracking. If so configured, the sensor will revert to a search mode to re-locate its target. Contrast with BREAK LOCK.

BROADBAND MICROWAVE ABSORPTION - A decrease in reflection of microwaves, caused by coatings of material whose electrical and magnetic properties have been altered to allow ABSORPTION of microwave energy at multiple frequencies. [4:17] Contrast with RESONANT MICROWAVE ABSORPTION.

EXTRANET - A private network that uses the INTERNET PROTOCOL and the public telecommunication system to securely share part of the using business's information or operations with suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, or other businesses. It is a Web site developed for customers, rather than the general public, providing access to research, current inventories and internal databases, and virtually any other private or proprietary information. [Computer Desktop Encylopedia. Computer Language Company, Inc., 2003]   NOTE: An extranet uses the public Internet as its transmission system, but requires passwords to gain entrance. Access to the site may be free or require payment for some or all of the services offered. The extranet can be viewed as part of a company's INTRANET that is extended to users outside the company. It has also been described as a 'state of mind' in which the Internet is perceived as a way to do business with other companies as well as to sell products to customers. Because of the need for security and privacy, extranets employ FIREWALLS, server management, digital certificates, user authentication, encryption of messages, and  VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS (VPN) are employed.

FARADAY CAGE - An electrically conducting cage, usually made of fine metallic mesh, used to protect devices and enclosed areas from radiation such as ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE (EMP) . [ ] NOTES:. (1) When an EMP hits this enclosure, its energy is absorbed by the conducting material of the cage, thus protecting its contents, such as when an airplane is struck by lightning; where the outer skin of an aircraft safely channels the energy away around the exterior without anyone or anything inside being affected. (2) Wires and conduits which are required to enter the Faraday cage must be 'bonded' electrically to the protecting mesh to electrically seal the enclosure. An unbonded connection will allow energy to enter and defeat the protective effect of the Faraday cage.

The device can project up to a 10-foot-wide laser beam as far as 300 feet. The beam is invisible to the naked eye and can be seen only with NIGHT-VISION equipment. []

FINGERPRINT - The human fingerprint is comprised of various types of ridge patterns, traditionally classified according to the decades-old Henry system: left loop, right loop, arch, whorl, and tented arch. Loops make up nearly 2/3 of all fingerprints, whorls are nearly 1/3, and perhaps 5-10% are arches. These classifications are relevant in many large-scale forensic applications, but are rarely used in biometric authentication. The fingerprint shown in Figure 1 below is a right loop.


FINGERPRINT CHARACTERISTICS    
     

Referring to Figure 1, the discontinuities that interrupt the otherwise smooth flow of ridges, are the basis for most finger-scan authentication. Codified in the late 1800's as Galton features, minutiae are at their most rudimentary ridge endings, the points at which a ridge stops, and bifurcations, the point at which one ridge divides into two. Many types of minutiae exist, including dots (very small ridges), islands (ridges slightly longer than dots, occupying a middle space between two temporarily divergent ridges), ponds or lakes (empty spaces between two temporarily divergent ridges), spurs (a notch protruding from a ridge), bridges (small ridges joining two longer adjacent ridges), and crossovers (two ridges which cross each other).

Other features are essential to finger-scan authentication. The core is the inner point, normally in the middle of the print, around which swirls, loops, or arches center. It is frequently characterized by a ridge ending and several acutely curved ridges. Deltas are the points, normally at the lower left and right hand of the fingerprint, around which a triangular series of ridges center. 

The ridges are also marked by pores, which appear at steady intervals. Some initial attempts have been made to use the location and distribution of the pores as a means of authentication, but the resolution required to capture pores consistently is very high. []

FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION UNIT (FIU) - A device which can independently enroll, compare, and verify the fingerprint of a finger placed at its sensor.  The FIU contains a biometric sensor that can reject phony fingers, duplicate fingerprint images, or other ersatz digits.   The system can be used for security applications, such as access control to files and machinery.  [10:2610]

FIXED VERY LOW FREQUENCY (FVLF) - A submarine broadcast system which is (2001) the primary command and control link to the submarine force.  It allows submarines to remain submerged and still receive operational communications.  [SPAWAR]   See also EXTREMELY LOW FREQUENCY (ELF).  NOTE:  The high power FVLF transmitter systems operate at 14.0 to 30.0 kHz, providing long range ocean area coverage.

FLAMELESS EXPULSION GRENADE - A NONLETHAL WEAPON consisting of a rubber ball grenade body that contains pulverized chemical agents (CN or CS).  No pyrotechnics are involved - a CO2 cartridge at the center of the grenade disperses the irritant through ports at the sides of the grenades.  [10:2745]

FORWARD SCATTERING - SCATTERING of an electromagnetic wave into directions that are at acute angles to the direction of propagation of the incident wave. [3]

FRAME FREQUENCY - The inverse of FRAME TIME.  []

FRAME TIME - The time required by a SCANNING sensor (active or passive) to execute one complete search scan.  []  See also SCANNING DETECTOR.

FRANGIBLE PROJECTILE - A NONLETHAL WEAPON projectile which disintegrates (e.g., turns to iron dust) upon striking a hard object.  The usual purpose is to limit collateral damage, such as behind a door or wall struck by the projectile.  []

FREE-ELECTRON LASER (FEL) - A directed energy weapon which employs accelerator technologies known as induction accelerators and radio frequency accelerators. [5:1] See also BEAM-PLASMA DEVICE; VIRTUAL-CATHODE OSCILLATOR ; CHEMICAL LASER; EXCIMER LASER; HIGH ENERGY LASER, X-RAY LASER. NOTES: (1) Free-electron lasers work by first depositing large amounts of energy in gases and then extracting some fraction of that energy in a collimated beam.  (2)  A free-electron laser can be controlled better than conventional lasers to perform a variety of militarily useful tasks 

FREQUENCY - The number of periods per unit time. Specifically, the number of identical cycles per second. [3] See also HERTZ.

FDR directly measures the phase difference between the incident and reflected waves; any faults in the line will generate resonances between the two signals, which are detected by the frequency domain reflectometer.    [10:2871]  See also SMART WIRE, STANDING WAVE REFLECTOMETRY (SWR) and TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY (TDR).

FREQUENCY HOPPING (FH) - A SPREAD SPECTRUM technique in which the transmitted frequency is pseudorandomly changed at a rate called the 'hopping rate'. [4:13] Contrast with DIRECT SEQUENCE SPREADING, TIME HOPPING. NOTE: In Frequency Hopping, the total available bandwidth is the spread bandwidth; however, the instantaneous bandwidth is less than the spread bandwidth. This technique is used in communications, radar, jamming, and other applications. 

FREQUENCY MODULATION (FM) - A form of ANGLE MODULATION in which the instantaneous frequency of a sine-wave CARRIER is caused to depart from the carrier frequency by an amount proportional to the instantaneous value of the modulating wave.  See also AMPLITUDE MODULATION (AM), PHASE MODULATION (PM).

[]   (2) FSS consists of low-cost engineered electromagnetic material used to control surface currents in antenna applications;  it features an array printed inductors and capacitors on a planar surface on the antenna. Two advantages of FSS are the size reduction of the physical antenna ( by nearly a factor of 2) and the reduction of detuning effects by objects in the antenna’s near field. [etenna FSS Info Sheet IS002-A 5/23/2003 ] NOTES: (1) The Ohio State University Center for Intelligent Transportation Research (CITR) used an FSS embedded in a road stripe as a lane locator for an autonomous vehicle demonstration system.

GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM (GLONASS) - A Russian small lightweight jammer designed to jam the Global Positioning System (GPS) []

GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) - A constellation of 24 operating satellites and three in-orbit spares (1995).  Each satellite continuously emits a pair of signals by which the system's precision and accuracy are achieved.  GPS receivers employed by various users can provide positioning accuracy to within centimeters.  [10:2573]  NOTE: The determining of position of a GPS receiver requires the simultaneous measurement of the distances to four orbiting satellites.  The measurement of raw range from a single satellite places the receiver on the surface of a sphere centered on the satellite with a radius equal to the measured range.  A simultaneous measurement of the range to a second satellite creates a second sphere that intersects the first and creates a sector upon which the receiver may be found.  A third measurement produces the intersection of three spheres with only two points common to all three.  One of these points will be in space, the other at the receiver's terrestrial position.  In theory, these three measurements should be sufficient to produce an unambiguous positional fix.  In practice, however, the inaccuracy of the user's inexpensive clock must be accommodated by a range measurement to a fourth satellite.  At this point there are four unknowns -- the user's longitude, latitude and altitude measured from the center of the earth, as well as the bias required to bring the user's clock error into synchronicity with system time and four independent range equations.  Solving the system of equations yields user position data to an accuracy of at least 15 meters and time to within 100 NANOSECONDs.  [10:2599]  There are at least two levels of precision associated with GPS --  Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) code, which involves ionospheric and geoid correction algorithms, and encrypted Precision (P) code, presumably for ballistic missile and other military usage.

OBJECTIVE FORCE WARRIOR (OFW) - A program (circa 2002) for designing and producing the warfighter's uniform.  Starting at the skin, the uniform is built outward, integrating as many functions as possible.  Intended to weigh about 50 pounds, the system will include multi-purpose electronics, including goggles what will allow the soldier to see in both the INFRARED and thermal realms, as well as have a HEAD-UP DISPLAY monocle positioned about 1.5 inches from either eye that will produce a virtual 19-inch color monitor of 800 x 600 pixels.  A warning system will be incorporated that will react to a trigger squeeze if the weapon is aimed at a friendly soldier.  The helmet will incorporate a GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) , radio, and infrared target designator and locator.  The traditional microphone will be replaced by a dime-sized sensor fastened to the head to transmit cranial vibrations to the communications system.  System voice control will allow the soldier to control the computer through the microphone.  For survivability, the uniform will include vented body armor.  Uniform-embedded body sensors will measure the diastolic and systolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, core body temperature and skin temperature - information which will be relayed to field medics so that they can respond to a wounded soldier.  Powered tourniquets will be embedded in sleeves and pant legs, and will be capable of being activated with one hand, and operate in a pulsing motions to allow limited blood flow to the limb.

Not to be confused with transmission frequency which is determined by the rate at which cycles are repeated within the transmitted pulse. [1] (2) The number of pulses per unit of time, usually seconds. [3] Synonymous with PULSE REPETITION RATE (PRR).

PULSE-WAVE® MYOTRON® - A NONLETHAL WEAPON consisting of a small box about the size of a pack of cigarettes.

The result is that the person falls to the ground in intense pain, unable to move, while vital functions such as heartbeat and breathing remain unaffected.  Recovery takes several minutes.  [10:2730]  NOTE:  E-mail communications from Mr. Wes Thomas point out that tests of the pulse wave myotron do not support the manufacturer's claims.  For example, it was claimed that the device can deliver up to 10,000 test bursts, but testing indicates that 4,000 bursts are more likely.  Also, Sandia National Laboratories tests (1998) indicate that there is no evidence to support the claim that the device 'intercepts and neutralizes brain waves from the motor cortex (voluntary muscle control) and hypothalamic (aggression) regions of the brain.'  [11.5]

MARQUISE
In FY 1999, NSA will flight test SOLITAIRE, the embedded high performance computer prototype
developed under the MARQUISE program, on an Air Force aircraft. The agency will continue research
on miniaturized, spray cooled, and embedded diamond power supplies. In FY 1999, NSA expects to
demonstrate a 48-Volt to 2.8-Volt @ 200 Amps high-efficiency power converter with a power density
of 2 Kwatts/inch 3 .
NSA continues to conduct research in embedded scalable nodes (the follow-on architecture to
MARQUISE) for mission scenarios, and has selected three potential repackaging implementations that
could make a 100 percent software-compatible, miniaturized high performance computer available six
months after the introduction of the commercial computer.
The SOLITAIRE board contains a complete SGI/CRAY J90
System Element, which includes four vector processors, network
crossbar, I/O, and 1/2 Gbyte of dynamic random access memory
(DRAM). There are nine diamond based die cast multichip
modules (MCMs) mounted on one side of the board and eight die
cast MCMs mounted on the reverse side. SOLITAIRE represents a
new achievement in double sided board column grid attachment,
featuring over 25,000 connections between the modules and the
board. This repackaging implementation of the System Element is
80 percent smaller and 75 percent lighter than the commercial
product, and concentrates 500 Watts onto a 10 inch square board.
Microelectronics in
high speed computing
Related NSA research areas include synthetic diamond packaging technology, all-optical switching, and
optoelectronic integrated circuit packaging technology. Other activities include:
Point-of-use power conversion for power reduction
Area array I/O design studies for low power implementations of high performance MCM
Very high level programmable accelerator plug-ins for standard architectures
Pictured to the left is a 128x128 superconductive crossbar switch.
The switch matrix is mounted on the 4"-diameter MCM and
maintained at 4 degrees Kelvin temperature. It is connected to its
room-temperature environment by an eight multichannel electrical
cable.

A spray cooled dc/dc converter can supply an impressive 200 W/in 3 .
This magnitude of miniaturization allows tight integration of the power
converter and electronics in a shared environment. Point of load
conversion eliminates heavy bus bars and rigid cables by distributing
power at high voltage and low current. Spray cooling results in relaxed
device specifications and improved reliability due to reduced operating
junction temperatures and thermal gradient. A 28 vdc/4 vdc spray
cooled converter is pictured to the left.
UPC
NSA's Center for Computing Sciences (CCS), in partnership with the University of California at
Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is developing UPC, a language that combines
features of the CCS-developed AC with features of Split-C and PCP, two other parallel C languages.
UPC represents an attempt to develop a base language that could become a standard for
explicitly-parallel C. UPC extends AC in three ways:
It adds keywords that enable programmers to control memory consistency to balance safety and
performance.
It enables blocking of arrays across processors to improve the performance and ease of
programming for select applications.
It introduces a "forall" concept to handle load balancing in loops that can be executed in parallel.
Quantum Computing
In FY 1998 and 1999, NSA will continue fundamental exploratory studies in quantum computation
theory and experimentation, including algorithms and complexity theory, quantum error correction
techniques, quantum decoherence processes, and small scale laboratory implementations.
HTMT
NSA's Hybrid Technology Multithreaded (HTMT) architecture effort is a collaborative project among a
dozen research groups (Caltech/JPL, University of Delaware, SUNY Stony Brook, University of Notre
Dame, Princeton University plus an association of other government and industry labs). The objective is
to define a very high performance computer system that can reach a petaflop level of performance in
significantly less time than a conventional approach. HTMT will be based on a unique multithreaded
execution model and will use a combination of leading-edge technologies, including superconducting
technology, high-speed VLSI semiconductor technology, optical interconnect, and storage technology.
The system is expected to be used in several critical high performance applications of national strategic
importance over the next decade.
An initial study of the original HTMT concept was funded by NSF and NASA in 1996-1997. A
comprehensive design study of HTMT is now sponsored by DARPA, NSA and NASA, and is

managed through Caltech and JPL. The research being performed at University of Delaware is focused
on the program execution and architecture model of HTMT.
High speed circuits
NSA is conducting research to determine whether electronics can handle the 100 Gb/s serial data rates
of fiber optic links. Uses include Tb/sec data transfer.
RES, JACKAL, and LOTS
RES, a system developed in 1991-1992 with NSA HPCC funds, was designed to harness "idle"
workstations. It is seeing increasingly widespread use and is the subject of continuing enhancement.
JACKAL is a cliche-based software reverse-engineering research system (where a "cliche" is an
"interesting" piece of code). Input to JACKAL is a high-level abstract language translation of source
code (when available) or decompiled code. JACKAL uses tree-matching and string-matching algorithms
to identify cliches.
Archival store for I/O is a major element in all computing systems. NSA is developing LOTS, an optical
tape system with ten times the storage per tape and at least ten times the input data rate compared with
conventional large stores.

Information security
NSA's Information Security (INFOSEC) Research Program continues to deliver a broad range of
security technology solutions. Fundamental mathematical work in cryptography, including elliptic curve
technology, has produced more secure and efficient algorithms for privacy protection and authentication,
while analytic work in electronic cash technology has provided valuable guidance to the financial and
legal communities. NSA has provided demonstrations and standards developments to ease the
integration of security services into commercial products and services. Engineering breakthroughs in
high speed/low power electronics and in optical encryption technology will provide the foundation for
emerging high performance communication systems. Improved biometric authentication techniques are
finding widespread acceptance for improving government and commercial access control systems.
Security enhancements for next generation operating systems and for object technology have been
developed and transferred to the R&D community. New visualization and risk assessment tools have
been developed and applied to assessing system security. Finally, NSA has established cooperation
across the INFOSEC research community to address network security.
NSA has developed a technology forecast and set of challenge problems that focus on the development
of a high assurance computing platform, technology for secure internetworking, and technologies
needed for a high assurance security management infrastructure. The technology needs and gaps of
these challenge problems will direct the bulk of NSA's INFOSEC research resources. Problem areas
that need to be addressed include the development of system security engineering methods to specify
and design security characteristics into a system; the management of network security and the
development of an infrastructure to support that management; tools and techniques to detect and respond
to local and national level attacks on critical information systems and infrastructure components; the
development of strong mechanisms to allow the controlled sharing of information among disparate

communities; and improved assurance technology for increasing the level of trust in the secure operation
of system hardware, software, and procedures. Following are some highlights:
NSA is conducting research on technologies for high-speed encryption. In 1997, NSA engineers,
in collaboration with DOE's Sandia National Laboratory, completed the design for an ATM
encryptor that operates at 10 Gbps. In 1998 they evaluate the vulnerability of the chip, which will
be a follow-on to the FASTLANE ATM encryptor. This design is capable of context (key,
algorithm, mode) agility rather than simply key agility.
NSA scientists have invented a process for fabricating etched mirrors on semiconductor laser
surfaces, a process necessary to cascade optical logic gates on a single chip, and an advancement
needed for the development of an all-optical encryptor.
NSA has authored the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP),
an Internet draft standard. NSA researchers are modeling ISAKMP and analyzing it for
completeness and security. The model contains more than 100 different data flow diagrams, state
transition diagrams, and mini-specifications. Included within the more than 50 state transition
diagrams are 250 states and over 600 state transitions. Future modeling will include interaction of
ISAKMP with other protocols.
NSA contracted with Virtual Motion Inc. to deliver a driver with a protocol structure that enables
a laptop user to encrypt network data independent of the particular vendor's wired or wireless PC
card. This improves the original idea of modifying each vendor's device driver to operate with a
Fortezza encryption card. A wireless local-area network was also developed that uses the Fortezza
card for security.
National Information
Assurance Partnership
program and Role-Based
Access Control
Under the NIAP program, NIST has partnered with NSA to establish a center to foster the development
of formal laboratories to test and certify security products against published formal specifications. This
program will help ensure that both vendors and users can cite third-party assurance of the functionality
and quality of security products and systems.
In the complex information technology environment, the careful and correct specification of rules to
control access to online documents, capabilities, or systems has become critical -- and increasingly
difficult. While traditional access control methods focus on individual users, files, or other system
objects, management of access in the real world is more often based on the role that a user assumes.
NIST has pioneered the new RBAC model that better meets the needs of user organizations and is
implementing it in environments, including a Web-based application.

NSA will flight test MARQUISE (the embedded High Performance Computer) on Air Force and Navy
aircraft. The agency will continue research on a miniaturized spray cooled embedded diamond power
supply and on embedded scalable nodes (follow-on architecture to MARQUISE) for mission scenarios.
NSA will continue joint NSA/University of Maryland research on microelectronics applied to high
speed computing, including very high speed (many Gb/s) optoelectronic devices and systems using 1.5

micron WDM interconnect technology. The program supports research on new electronic (Si) structures
for future very high speed, high density very large scale integration (VLSI) with feature sizes well
below 0.1 micron and supports research in silicon surface science.
Research also includes synthetic diamond packaging technology, all-optical switching, and
optoelectronic integrated circuit (IC) packaging technology. Expected FY 1998 accomplishments include
point-of-use power conversion (for power reduction), area array I/O design studies for low power
implementations of high performance multichip module (MCM), and studying and prototyping very
high level programmable accelerator plug-ins for standard architectures. FY 1998 efforts will continue
research in quantum computing in association with NIST, DOE laboratories, and other research
agencies.
Create a prototype for a powerful, mobile, front-end processor that supports high capacity I/O,
high performance computing, high utilization of peak processor performance (50 to 80 percent),
and is programmable in a high level language such as C or C++.
Develop a multi-gigabit per second crossbar switch for supercomputer and data transfer
applications. This work is to demonstrate a 128x128 crossbar switch with 2.5 Gb/s per port data
rate and a latency less than 10 ns. The device technology is cryogenic superconductive digital
circuits. The final system components will be selected and assembly begun during FY 1997 and
continue through FY 1998 for an FY 1999 delivery of:
· An operational 128 X 128 superconductive crossbar switch
· A 100 Gb/s serial to parallel device with clock recovery
· Two types of 16 Kb subnanosecond access-time memory chips—one room temperature and one
superconductive.
NSA will continue its very high speed networking R&D by applying the latest technologies to
inter-agency testbeds that can be migrated to deployment. Enabling technologies such as materials and
photonics research are being studied for new capabilities to speed processing power and enhance
sensitivity. In FY 1998, NSA expects to have in place all the parts necessary for a truly Gb/s Internet,
capable of supporting multiple individual data streams, each at 2.4 Gb/s, over ATM and IP. Installation
of all-optical networks will begin. The Washington, DC, area ATDnet will act as a public network
capable of interconnection with an all-optical (crossbar) network, acting as a DoD private network, as
well as use individual wavelengths for support of "legacy" ATM networks.
NSA will demonstrate solutions to high assurance configurable security architectures. NSA will
continue constructing prototypes to enable the efficient replacement of security policies and security
mechanisms with minimal impact on system service or assurance. Research solutions will be integrated
into future commercial technology via collaboration with various research labs. This effort will include:
integration of security research results into advanced operating system technologies; creation of system
framework for flexible authentication services; and securing computing related to distributed and mobile
computing. NSA will continue development of functional devices including core cryptographic
processors, numeric processors, high speed memories, and test and characterization devices. It will also
explore related silicon technologies that employ high speed, low power characteristics.
National Security Agency
The National Security Agency (NSA) has traditionally influenced and been a very early and
sophisticated user of the highest performance commercial computer, storage, and networking systems.

For these reasons, NSA actively participated in the original HPCC studies which led to the Federal
HPCC program. Through the entire period of growth of high performance computing and networking,
spanning several decades, NSA has stimulated both industry and academia with some of the most
challenging problems in the nation. A number of major U.S. computer companies are now using
hardware and software technology in their products which originated at NSA. This role must continue,
both to assure the availability of increasingly higher performance systems to meet the nation's national
security interests and to ensure that benefits of NSA's activities accrue to the overall advantage of the
industry and the satisfaction of other HPCC Grand Challenges.
NSA will continue to pursue high performance computing and very high speed networks in order to
perform its mission. Many of these programs will also contribute directly to the overall goals of HPCC.
NSA sponsors divisions of the Institute for Defense Analyses (an FFRDC) to do most of this research.
Results of programs and external drivers have led to revised priorities and funding levels for the
supercomputing, superconducting, and very high speed research programs.

Since information about the NSA R2 research program is less-widely available than for relevant
programs at DARPA and other federal agencies, the entire committee visited NSA for a more in-depth
examination of R2's research program; subsequent meetings involving NSA R2 personnel and a subset
of the committee provided still further input to the study.
***
NSA funds information security research through R2 and other of its organizational units. The present
study deals exclusively with R2. In contrast to DARPA, NSA R2 consumes a large portion of its
budget internally, including significant expenditures on nonresearch activities. NSA's two missions-
protecting U.S. sensitive information and acquiring foreign intelligence information-can confound its
interactions with others in the promotion of trustworthiness. Its defensive mission makes knowing how
to protect systems paramount; its offensive need to exploit system vulnerabilities can inhibit its sharing
of knowledge. This tension is not new. What is relevant for future effort is the lingering distrust for the
agency in the academic research community and some quarters of industry, which has had a negative
impact on R2' s efforts at outreach. The rise of NISs creates new needs for expertise in computer
systems that NSA is challenged to develop internally and procure externally. R2's difficulty in recruiting
and retaining highly qualified technical research staff is a reason for "outsourcing" research, when
highly skilled research staff are available elsewhere. R2's effectiveness depends on better leveraging of
talent both outside and inside the organization.
***
Within the federal government, external research relating to information systems trustworthiness is
coordinated by the interagency Computing, Information, and Communications (CIC) R&D
Subcommittee. About 12 federal departments and agencies participate in coordinating program planning,
budgeting, and review. The CIC R&D Subcommittee is divided into five components and
trustworthiness activity is largely associated with the High Confidence Systems (HCS) component. 87 n
terms of research support, NSA and DARPA dominate the CIC agencies involved with HCS, with FY
1997 spending listed as $7.3 million and $10 million, respectively, out of a $30 million component total.
Other components include High End Computing and Computation, Large Scale Networking, Human
Centered Systems, and Education, Training, and Human Resources -- each of which can contribute to or
be affected by trustworthiness.

The federal government has sought to promote coordination among entities on trustworthiness R&D,
and it has linked defense and civilian and mission and research agencies through the HCS working
group. There is also an evolving information security (infosec) research council that includes DARPA,
DISA, NSA, NIST, DOE, the CIA, and the military services. The PCCIP has recommended additional
interagency coordination structures, building on the teams it assembled while conducting its work. 88
The focused coordination effort comes from the DARPA-NSA-DISA Joint Technology Office (JTO).
Specifically, the role of the Information Systems Security Research-Joint Technology Office
(ISSR-JTO) is "to optimize use of the limited research funds available, and strengthen the
responsiveness of the programs to DISA, expediting delivery of technologies that meet DISA's
requirements to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability of data in
Department of Defense information systems, provide a robust first line of defense for defensive
information warfare, and permit electronic commerce between the Department of Defense and its
contractors." 89
National Security Agency
The National Security Agency is responsible for (1) providing intelligence through the interception,
collection, decryption, translation, and processing of foreign communications signals and (2) developing
cryptographic and other information security techniques to protect classified and unclassified (but
sensitive) U.S. communications and computer systems associated with national security. 90 In support of
its information security mission, the NSA has historically developed very high quality cryptographic
equipment and keying material for the Department of Defense and other customers in the U.S.
government (e.g., the State Department). For years, the primary focus of the NSA was on protecting the
confidentiality of communications. As the boundary between communications and computing has
blurred, the NSA has focused its protection on information security rather than more narrowly on
communications security (see Box 6.6).
The growing dependence on COTS technology in the DOD necessitates a strong NSA interest in COTS
trustworthiness and the integration of cryptography into COTS products. NSA's special customer
market is small enough and the potential for NSA control is sufficient to discourage many producers of
COTS products from meeting NSA's special needs directly; because of its low and shrinking influence
on the market, NSA needs to understand and work with COTS technology and vendors. The shift to
COTS products raises questions about the scope of national security concerns and what they imply for
technology strategies to meet the needs of national security entities, the primary client of NSA.
Partnerships with Industry
Increasingly, partnering with industry is seen as an approach for lowering government research costs,
ensuring the relevance of solutions, and expediting the transfer of research into products. On the other
hand, anecdotal evidence 91 points to concerns about the direct and opportunity costs of engineering
efforts that respond to NSA's concerns without generating products that see widespread use (Mayfield
et al., 1997). Meanwhile, growing recognition of the need for trustworthiness combined with increased
dependence on NISs continues to lead more organizations (e.g., banks) with high levels of concern
about information security to approach NSA for consultation and assistance. The National Computer
Security Center was formed by NSA in the early 1980s as a communications conduit for information
security technology. More recently, the NSA National Cryptologic Strategy described and encouraged a
"zone of cooperation" among the law enforcement and national security communities, the public sector
generally, and the private sector.
Another example of reaching out is the NSA effort in the early 1990s concerning the Multilevel
Information Systems Security Initiative (MISSI), which was originally intended to provide a set of
products and an architectural framework that would facilitate the development of multilevel secure NISs.
7 of 15
5/27/07 9:12 PMNSA Research 1998
http://www.ussrback.com/crypto/nsa/nsa-research/
A key aspect of MISSI was to promote broader use of Fortezza technology 92 through partnerships with
industry. MISSI embodied the view that secure hardware and software had to be developed together,
something that the COTS market eschews. For this and other reasons, it is widely acknowledged that
MISSI was both a technical and marketplace failure; nevertheless, the multilevel security concerns
embodied in MISSI -- that truly secure solutions require integrated approaches -- continue to shape
NSA management thinking. 93 An alternate way to leverage COTS technology is through the
development of standards, such as common application programming interfaces (APIs) that permit the
development and use of security products with differing strength. Such standards have promise in
satisfying the needs of diverse communities of security customers. The use of APIs seems to the
committee to be more appealing to industry than MISSI, although acknowledging that APIs and MISSI
are not directly comparable because APIs do not address system security or assurance issues. However,
APIs are consistent with the notion that successful solutions in industry are likely to be add-ons, rather
than integrative solutions. Furthermore, some APIs, notably those for cryptographic functions, can run
afoul of export control restrictions.
The U.S. Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) effort represents a further attempt by
NSA to partner with the private sector. In this area, NSA insisted on specific conceptual models and
corresponding technology, such as the information flow security models for access control at higher
levels of the TCSEC. The result was a different and more costly orientation to authentication and access
control than evidenced by policy models apparent in industry. No commercially viable products emerged
from this effort, and today it is regarded as essentially irrelevant to current COTS information
technology.
The effectiveness of such outreach efforts has been limited in the past by such factors as public mistrust
of a historically secretive agency; the lack of public awareness, understanding, and support for the
TCSEC and Evaluated Product List; and the ambiguity inherent in a public outreach arm in an agency
constrained by statute to national security interests (CSTB, 1991). Current efforts may prove more
successful, but they must overcome a legacy of suspicion originating in NSA's traditional secrecy as
well as its role in controversies surrounding such efforts as the TCSEC, Clipper chip/Fortezza, and its
desires for controls on exports of information security devices. 94
Other factors inhibit cooperation between NSA and the private sector. The environment in which
private-sector information security needs are manifested may be different enough from the defense and
foreign policy worlds that these technologies may not be particularly relevant in practice to the private
sector. Furthermore, the rapid pace of commercial developments in information technology may make it
difficult for the private sector to use technologies developed for national security purposes in a less
rapidly changing environment (CSTB, 1996).
R2 Program
To support its mission, NSA funds and conducts research through an organization called R, which has
research subunits and staff groups that provide support for technology forecasting and infosec research
outreach. R2 is the NSA research subunit responsible for information security research programs; it is
organized into three research divisions: cryptography, engineering, and computer science. In 1997 R2
had over 100 staff and a contracting budget in the tens of millions of dollars, a portion of which is
coordinated with DARPA.
The major foci of R2 research are enumerated in Box 6.7. The dominant areas of R2 research are secure
communications technology, assurance technology, and security management infrastructure. 96 Although
cryptography has been the centerpiece of NSA's communication security products and is the dominant
technique for providing security within NISs, cryptography was not identified as a dominant emphasis.
Classified research and research performed by other NSA research elements and other government and
government-supported research organizations presumably provide research support to NSA in this area.
8 of 15
5/27/07 9:12 PMNSA Research 1998
http://www.ussrback.com/crypto/nsa/nsa-research/
The NSA and its R2 organization have developed close working relationships with a group of
companies and organizations that have acquired a significant understanding of NSA's goals and the
technologies involved in satisfying those goals. A large portion of the research work funded by R2 is
conducted by selected contractors, federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), and
researchers at national laboratories (e.g., work on quantum cryptography, an example of the more
fundamental work supported by R2). Although R2 does not, for the most part, use the same open
solicitation process used by DARPA, for example, it does review and sometimes funds proposals
submitted to DARPA. Such coordination is a goal of the JTO.
R2's small University Research Program (URP) publishes open solicitations for research and provides
modest security-related contracts ($50,000 to $100,000) to principal investigators in a number of
colleges and universities. The program is intended to encourage professors to work in computer and
communications security, although published results have not been noteworthy. For example, R2 has
supported operating systems (OS) work that its management recognizes has not affected mainstream OS
work and formal methods work that also has had limited impact (e.g., formal verification tools have not
been developed as hoped for).
In a recent study (Anderson et al., 1998), 45 NSA-funded projects in the area of information system
security and survivability were identified. Although the enumeration may not be comprehensive, it does
indicate the nature and scope of the research funded by NSA (see Appendix J).
Of R2's contract funds, a significant portion goes to support nonresearch activities such as participation
in standards-setting organizations (e.g., the Internet Engineering Task Force, where R2 contributed the
ISAKMP protocol to the IPsec standards effort), consortia membership (e.g., the ATM Forum, where
R2 also contributed to security protocol standards), and support for infosec education (e.g., Biometrics
consortium, Network Security Management Forum, and support for infosec studies at the Naval
Postgraduate School and the University of Maryland). Numerous activities, both external and contract
funded, are focused on understanding and assessing various products and technologies (e.g., hacker
tools, cryptography for electronic-cash). R2 also supports several efforts to modify COTS products to
incorporate new or expanded security functionality (e.g., biometrics access controls and intrusion
detection for Windows NT).
Issues for the Future. The committee reviewed a draft of R2's "Information System Security Research
Program Plan," which was revised multiple times in 1996-1997. 97 This plan calls for greater interaction
with the entire infosec community and a more open but focused R2 research program, which would be
based on input from an infosec research council (sponsored by NSA and including participants from the
relevant agencies and the military services), a national infosec technical baseline (established by NSA,
DOE, and DOE's national laboratories), and an infosec science and technology study group (composed
of leading experts who would provide an infosec perspective from the private sector). By design, the
draft plan would support technology R&D "consistent with the fundamental security principles and
concepts articulated in the DOD Goal Security Architecture" (Burnham, 1997). To ensure a supply of
knowledgeable experts in the future, the draft plan calls for the establishment of academic centers for
infosec studies and research. The plan also emphasizes technology transfer to the infosec side of NSA,
to the military services, and to industry.
The committee believes that R2 faces two related challenges. One challenge is its research portfolio.
Because NSA both funds external infosec research and performs internal infosec research, questions
arise as to the appropriate allocation of effort (internal and external) and its coordination. Decisions
about internal effort, like decisions about external effort, should recognize where the parties have
comparative advantage. Highly classified cryptographic research is a natural choice for internal research;
NSA has widely recognized strength in that area and has better access to mathematical talent in terms of
both caliber and number or researchers. Other areas of trustworthiness, less constrained by classification
requirements, seem more appropriate for R2 to pursue externally.

The second critical issue is the recruitment, retention, and continuing education of high-quality talent to
pursue noncryptographic trustworthiness research areas. In these areas, especially those that depend on
computer science, highly skilled researchers available in many academic and commercial organizations
can make significant contributions to infosec technology. R2 will have to compete for that talent with
other agencies that have established relationships with top researchers. Furthermore, top-tier talent with
security expertise is scarce, and nongovernment employers would appear to offer more rewards, from
recognition to pay (Lardner, 1998). Skills developed in an infosec research group, especially those
relating to network security, cryptography, and COTS software, are easily marketable in the commercial
sector -- a fact that constrains both hiring and retention in R2. Finally, there is the perception that the
"cloak and dagger image" that once attracted some people to NSA is no longer as strong, because of a
smaller defense budget and rapidly growing private-sector alternatives (Lardner, 1998).
As previously indicated, senior management at NSA and NSA advisory groups have stated that it is
difficult to obtain and retain highly qualified technical research staff with computer-related expertise for
the R2 organization. 98 Within R2, staff is spread thinly, and loss of an individual can have a significant
impact on organizational coverage. Further, the ability of a technologist to do research is reportedly
limited by administrative and other obligations. The adoption of a rotation program, comparable to those
at the NSF and DARPA for program managers, could be considered as a complement to hiring regular
staff members. To be effective, such a program would have to be carefully designed to attract the desired
researchers to the NSA.
R2 may be at a disadvantage within NSA inasmuch as its work is removed from fielded results that
constitute NSA successes and its work is not as directly linked to NSA's mission as that of other units.
These circumstances can constrain internal communication, and anecdotal evidence suggests that R2
may not always benefit from knowledge of relevant work done by sister units. By contrast, program
managers pursuing trustworthiness topics at DARPA and NSF have more visibility, and they and the
researchers they fund are free to publish their results.
Although R2 funds and performs unclassified work, it shares the NSA environment and mind-set of
tightly controlled information. This environment presents a real conflict with the need for access to open
research information. It can encourage a closed community of workers who do not communicate with
others in the community either to seek or contribute information. Although R2 has increased its
outreach, the conferences in which it seems most active as an organization, the NSA-NIST-sponsored
National Information System Security Conference and its own Tech Fest, tend to attract a small
community of researchers with long-standing connections to NSA. These audiences have only limited
interaction with the larger community of computer science researchers with whom other HCS agency
program managers have regular contact.
Findings
1. Some government customers have particularly high needs for security, and there are a handful of
systems (e.g., "The President's Laptop") that face levels of threat and require the strength of a
mechanism that is not available in commercial products and that would have insufficient demand to
support a product in the marketplace. The NSA is particularly well situated to develop such
mechanisms. Classified cryptographic research is also a natural fit for the NSA internal research
program.
2. The R2 university research program emphasizes relatively short term and small projects. Such
projects do not tend to attract the interest of the best industrial and academic researchers and institutions.
3. Rotation of R2 researchers with researchers in industry and academia could help to broaden and
invigorate the R2 program. Such rotation would be most effective with institutions that have large
numbers of leading researchers.

4. Inadequate incentives currently exist in R2 to attract and retain highly skilled researchers. Improved
incentives might be financial (e.g., different salary scale) and/or nonfinancial (e.g., special recognition,
greater public visibility). R2 faces formidable challenges in the recruitment and retention of the very best
researchers.
5. R2 has initiated several outreach efforts, but these efforts have not significantly broadened the
community of researchers who work with R2. Effective outreach efforts are those that are designed to
be compatible with the interests, perspectives, and real needs of potential partners.
BOX 6.6
The NSA Mission: From Communications Security to Information Security
The 1995 NSA Corporate Plan for Information Systems Security laid out a broad mission:
"[NSA's] INFOSEC [information security] mission is to provide leadership, products, and
services necessary to enable customers to protect national security and sensitive information in
information systems pursuant to federal law and national policies, and to provide technical support
to the government's efforts to incorporate information systems security into the national
information infrastructure. Our customers include national security community members handling
classified and sensitive information, as well as those civil government agencies and, when
requested, private sector organizations providing vital national services. We serve our customers by
assessing their needs, delivering solutions, and creating advanced INFOSEC technologies. We also
promote security for the national information infrastructure through our policy and standards work,
our efforts in public advocacy and education, and our role in shaping commercially available
security technology" (p. ii). More recently, the 1996 National Cryptologic Strategy for the 21st
Century 110 explicitly related military and commercial vulnerability to interconnectivity,
interoperability, and increased reliance on commercial off-the-shelf products and services.
BOX 6.7

The NSA R2 organization must increase its efforts devoted to outreach and recruitment and
retention issues.
R2 has initiated several outreach efforts, but these have not significantly broadened the community of
researchers that work with R2. Effective outreach efforts are those that are designed to be compatible
with the interests, perspectives, and realities of potential partners (e.g., acknowledgment of the
dominance of COTS technology).
Inadequate incentives currently exist within R2 to attract and retain highly skilled researchers. Improved
incentives might be financial (e.g., different salary scale) and/or nonfinancial (e.g., special recognition,
greater public visibility) in nature. R2 faces formidable challenges in the recruitment and retention of the
very best researchers. The rotation of R2 researchers with researchers in industry and academia would
help to broaden and invigorate the R2 program. Such rotation would be most effective if it involved
institutions that have large numbers of top researchers. As currently constituted, the R2 university
research program emphasizes relatively short-term and small projects, and it does not attract the interest
of the best industrial and academic researchers and institutions.

Research in Information System Security and Survivability
Funded
by the NSA and DARPA
In a recent study, Anderson et al. (1998) identified a total of 104 individual research projects that were
funded by DARPA's Information Survivability program, a unit of the Information Technology Office
(ITO), in FY 1998. In addition, 45 information security projects were identified from the NSA and were
included in the Anderson et al. (1998) study. These projects were categorized as depicted below (some
projects were counted in two categories).

87 The HCS program was announced as one of six focus areas in the 1995 Strategic Implementation
Plan of the Committee on Information and Communications (CIC) R&D, which coordinates computing
and communications R&D across the federal government. CIC planning includes R&D activity in the
areas of components, communications, computing systems, support software and tools, intelligent
systems, information management, and applications.
88 The JTO was announced in the 1995 "ARPA/DISA/NSA Memorandum of Agreement Concerning
the Information Systems Security Research Joint Technology Office." Complementing DARPA's
ongoing research program relating to system security as well as NSA's research efforts, the Joint
Technology Office (JTO) is intended to further coordination of research and technology development
relevant to meeting DOD's needs for trustworthy systems. It also aims to make the goals and
decision-making processes for such R&D more open and responsive to public needs and concerns.
Organized as a "virtual" entity that draws on personnel and resources otherwise housed at the
participating agencies, the JTO is expected to harmonize the individual agency programs much as the
High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative has harmonized those of its component
agencies, while leaving research management (e.g., broad area announcements in the case of DARPA)
and ultimate source selection decision making to those agencies.
89 See "Memorandum of Agreement Between the Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense
Information Systems Agency, and the National Security Agency Concerning the Information Systems
Security Research Joint Technology Office''; MOA effective April 2, 1995. The full text of the MOA is
available online at http://www.ito.darpa.mil/ResearchAreas/Information_Survivability/MOA.html.
90 Under the National Security Act of 1947, a restructured intelligence community was created.
Subsequent executive orders have revised or reordered the intelligence community (and continue to do
so). The National Security Agency (which replaced the Armed Forces Security Agency) was created by
presidential directive by President Truman in 1952. A number of documents that describe NSA's
mission are classified, but a basic mission statement is now available on an NSA Web site,
http://www.nsa gov:8080.
91 Such evidence includes the experiences of committee members.
92 Fortezza was originally designed for use with only unclassified data. Other products, never

deployed, were to provide analogous cryptographic protection for classified data. However, over time
MISSI's focus changed (see Chapter 4, Box 4.4, for additional details).
93 Committee discussion with R2 managers, October 21, 1996. 94 This distrust and suspicion of NSA
is enhanced by NSA's history of control-oriented interactions with industry. The technology
marketplace is a worldwide marketplace. For many companies at least half of their income is derived
from outside of the United States. Advanced technology, especially cryptography, is subject to export
controls, and NSA has played a significant role in advising the U.S. government on which technologies
can be exported as commodities. The recent declassification of SKIPJACK and KEA is a step in the
right direction; the declassification was done explicitly to allow industry to implement
Fortezza-compatible software, thus enabling very low cost cryptographic "soft tokens."
95 For example, military users may be willing to tolerate a higher degree of inconvenience to obtain the
benefits of security.
96 As reflected in unclassified briefings and materials on funding and staffing levels provided to the
committee.
97 Authored by Blaine Burnham, NSA. This document was provided to the committee by R2 when the
committee asked for insight into R2's thinking about future directions. The committee examined this
document not as a formal plan for NSA, but as a white paper -- as a source of possibilities for the
future.
98 They note that R2 has not recruited from the academic researchers it supports.
110 John Davis, NCSC director, described this program to the committee during its October 21 visit to
NSA, using July 1996 briefing charts. [See also http://www.nsa.gov:8080/programs/ncs21/ ]
