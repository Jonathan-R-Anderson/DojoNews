Military interest in space became intense during and after
World War II because of the introduction of rocket
science, the companion to nuclear technology. The early
versions include the buzz bomb and guided missiles.
They were thought of as potential carriers of both nuclear
and conventional bombs.
Rocket technology and nuclear weapon technology
developed simultaneously between 1945 and 1963.
During this time of intensive atmospheric nuclear testing,
explosions at various levels above and below the surface
of the earth were attempted. Some of the now familiar
descriptions of the earth's protective atmosphere, such as
the existence of the Van Allen belts, were based on
information gained through stratospheric and ionospheric
experimentation.
The earth's atmosphere consists of the troposphere, from
sea level to about 16 km above the earth's surface; the
stratosphere (which contains the ozone level) which
extends from about the 16 to 48 km above the earth; and
the ionosphere which extends from 48 km to over 50,000
km above the surface of the earth.
The earth's protective atmosphere or 'skin' extends
beyond 3,200 km above sea level to the large magnetic
fields, called the Van Allen Belts, which can capture the
charged particles sprayed through the cosmos by the
solar and galactic winds. These belts were discovered in
1958 during the first weeks of the operation of America's
first satellite, Explorer I. They appear to contain charged
particles trapped in the earth's gravity and magnetic
fields. Primary galactic cosmic rays enter the solar
system from interstellar space, and are made up of
protons with energies above 100 MeV, extending up to
astronomically high energies. They make up about 100
percent of the high energy rays. Solar rays are generally
of lower energy, below 20 MeV (which is still high energy
in earth terms). These high energy particles are affected
by the earth's magnetic field and by geomagnetic latitude
(distance above or below the geomagnetic equator). Theflux density of low energy protons at the top of the
atmosphere is normally greater at the poles than at the
equator. The density also varies with solar activity, being
at a minimum when solar flares are at a minimum.
The Van Allen belts capture charged particles (protons,
electrons and alpha particles) and these spiral along the
magnetic force lines toward the polar regions where the
force lines converge. They are reflected back and forth
between the magnetic force lines near the poles. The
lower Van Allen Belt is about 7700 km above the earth's
surface, and the outer Van Allen Belt is about 51,500 km
above the surface. According to the Encyclopedia
Britannica, the Van Allen belts are most intense along the
equator, and effectively absent over the poles. They dip
to 400 km over the South Atlantic Ocean, and are about
1,000 km high over the Central Pacific Ocean. In the
lower Van Allen Belt, the proton intensity is about 20,000
particles with energy above 30 MeV per second per
square centimeter. Electrons reach a maximum energy of
1 MeV, and their intensity has a maximum of 100 million
per second per square centimeter. In the outer Belt,
proton energy averages only 1 MeV. For compar-ison,
most charged particles discharged in a nuclear explosion
range between 0.3 and 3 MeV, while diagnostic medical
X-ray has peak voltage around 0.5 MeV.
Project Argus (1958)
Between August and September 1958, the US Navy
exploded three fission type nuclear bombs 480 km above
the South Atlantic Ocean, in the part of the lower Van
Allen Belt closest to the earth's surface. In addition, two
hydrogen bombs were detonated 160 km over Johnston
Island in the Pacific. The military called this 'the biggest
scientific experiment ever undertaken.' It was designed
by the US Department of Defense and the US Atomic
Energy Commission, under the code name Project Argus.
The purpose appears to be to assess the impact of high
altitude nuclear explosions on radio transmission and
radar operations because of the electromagnetic pulse
(EMP), and to increase understanding of the geomagnetic
field and the behavior of the charged particles in it.
This gigantic experiment created new (inner) magnetic
radiation belts encompassing almost the whole earth, and
injected sufficient electrons and other energetic particles
into the ionosphere to cause world wide effects. The
electrons traveled back and forth along magnetic force
lines, causing an artificial 'aurora' when striking theatmosphere near the North Pole.
The US Military planned to create a 'telecommunications
shield' in the ionosphere, reported in 13-20 August 1961,
Keesings Historisch Archief (K.H.A.). This shield would be
created 'in the ionosphere at 3,000 km height, by
bringing into orbit 350,000 million copper needles, each 2-
4 cm long [total weight 16 kg], forming a belt 10 km thick
and 40 km wide, the needles spaced about 100 m apart.'
This was designed to replace the ionosphere 'because
telecommunications are impaired by magnetic storms and
solar flares.' The US planned to add to the number of
copper needles if the experiment proved to be successful.
This plan was strongly opposed by the Intentional Union
of Astronomers.
Project Starfish (1962)
On July 9, 1962, the US began a further series of
experiments with the ionosphere. From their description:
'one kiloton device, at a height of 60 km and one
megaton and one multi-megaton, at several hundred
kilometers height' (K.H.A., 29 June 1962). These tests
seriously disturbed the lower Van Allen Belt, substantially
altering its shape and intensity. 'In this experiment the
inner Van Allen Belt will be practically destroyed for a
period of time; particles from the Belt will be transported
to the atmosphere. It is anticipated that the earth's
magnetic field will be disturbed over long distances for
several hours, preventing radio communication. The
explosion in the inner radiation belt will create an artificial
dome of polar light that will be visible from Los Angeles'
(K.H.A. 11 May 1962). A Fijian Sailor, present at this
nuclear explosion, told me that the whole sky was on fire
and he thought it would be the end of the world. This was
the experiment which called forth the strong protest of the
Queen's Astronomer, Sir Martin Ryle in the UK.
'The ionosphere [according to the under-standing at that
time] that part of the atmosphere between 65 and 80 km
and 280- 320 km height, will be disrupted by mechanical
forces caused by the pressure wave following the
explosion. At the same time, large quantities of ionizing
radiation will be released, further ionizing the gaseous
components of the atmosphere at this height. This
ionization effect is strengthened by the radiation from the
fission products... The lower Van Allen Belt, consisting of
charged particles that move along the geomagnetic field
lines... will similarly be disrupted. As a result of the
explosion, this field will be locally destroyed, whilecountless new electrons will be introduced into the lower
belt' (K.H.A. 11 May 1962). 'On 19 July... NASA
announced that as a consequence of the high altitude
nuclear test of July 9, a new radiation belt had been
formed, stretching from a height of about 400 km to 1600
km; it can be seen as a temporary extension of the lower
Van Allen Belt' (K.H.A. 5 August 1962).
As explained in the Encyclopedia Britannica: '... Starfish
made a much wider belt [than Project Argus] that extends
from low altitude out past L=3 [i.e. three earth radiuses or
about 13,000 km above the surface of the earth].' Later in
1962, the USSR undertook similar planetary experiments,
creating three new radiation belts between 7,000 and
13,000 km above the earth. According to the
Encyclopedia, the electron fluxes in the lower Van Allen
Belt have changed markedly since the 1962 high- altitude
nuclear explosions by the US and USSR, never returning
to their former state. According to American scientists, it
could take many hundreds of years for the Van Allen
Belts to destabilize at their normal levels. (Research done

32, 6136 CH Sittard, Netherlands.)
SPS: Solar Power Satellite Project (1968)
In 1968 the US military proposed Solar Powered
Satellites in geostationary orbit some 40,000 km above
the earth, which would intercept solar radiation using
solar cells on satellites and transmit it via a microwave
beam to receiving antennas, called rectennas, on earth.
The US Congress mandated the Department of Energy
and NASA to prepare an Environmental Impact
Assessment on this project, to be completed by June
1980, and costing $25 Million. This project was designed
to construct 60 Solar Powered Satellites over a thirty year
period at a cost between $500 and $800 thousand million
(in 1968 dollars), providing 100 percent of the US energy
needs in the year 2025 at a cost of $3000 per kW. At that
time, the project cost was two to three times larger than
the whole Department of Energy budget, and the
projected cost of the electricity was well above the cost of
most conventional energy sources. The rectenna sites on
earth were expected to take up to 145 square kilometers
of land, and would preclude habitation by any humans,
animals or even vegetation. Each Satellite was to be the
size of Manhattan Island.
Saturn V Rocket (1975)Due to a malfunction, the Saturn V Rocket burned
unusually high in the atmosphere, above 300 km. This
burn produced 'a large ionospheric hole' (Mendillo, M. Et
al., Science p. 187, 343, 1975). The disturbance reduced
the total electron content more than 60% over an area
1,000 km in radius, and lasted for several hours. It
prevented all telecommunications over a large area of the
Atlantic Ocean. The phenomenon was apparently caused
by a reaction between the exhaust gases and ionospheric
oxygen ions. The reaction emitted a 6300 A airglow.
Between 1975 and 1981 NASA and the US Military began
to design ways to test this new phenomena through
deliberate experimentation with the ionosphere.
SPS Military Implications (1978)
Early review of the Solar Powered Satellite Project began
in around 1978, and I was on the review panel. Although
this was proposed as an energy program, it had
significant military implications. One of the most
significant, first pointed out by Michael J. Ozeroff, was the
possibility of developing a satellite-borne beam weapon
for anti-ballistic missile (ABM) use. The satellites were to
be in geosynchronous orbits, each providing an excellent
vantage point from which an entire hemisphere can be
surveyed continuously. It was speculated that a high-
energy laser beam could function as a thermal weapon to
disable or destroy enemy missiles. There was some
discussion of electron weapon beams, through the use of
a laser beam to preheat a path for the following electron
beam.
The SPS was also described as a psychological and anti-
personnel weapon, which could be directed toward an
enemy. If the main microwave beam was redirected away
from its rectenna, toward enemy personnel, it could use
an infrared radiation wave- length (invisible) as an anti-
personnel weapon. It might also be possible to transmit
high enough energy to ignite combustible materials.
Laser beam power relays could be made from the SPS
satellite to other satellites or platforms, for example
aircraft, for military purposes. One application might be a
laser powered turbofan engine which would receive the
laser beam directly in its combustion chamber, producing
the required high temperature gas for its cruising
operation. This would allow unlimited on-station cruise
time. As a psychological weapon, the SPS was capable
of causing general panic
The SPS would be able to transmit power to remotemilitary operations anywhere needed on earth. The
manned platform of the SPS would provide surveillance
and early warning capability, and ELF linkage to
submarines. It would also provide the capability of
jamming enemy communications. The potential for
jamming and creating communications is significant. The
SPS was also capable of causing physical changes in the
ionosphere
President Carter approved the SPS Project and gave it a
go- ahead, in spite of the reservation which many
reviewers, myself included, expressed. Fortunately, it was
so expensive, exceeding the entire Department of Energy
budget, that funding was denied by the Congress. I
approached the United Nations Committee on
Disarmament on this project, but was told that as long as
the program was called Solar Energy by the United
States, it could not be considered a weapons project. The
same project resurfaced in the US under President
Reagan. He moved it to the much larger budget of the
Department of Defense and called it Star Wars. Since this
is more recent history, I will not discuss the debate which
raged over this phase of the plan.
By 1978, it was apparent to the US Military that
communications in a nuclear hostile environment would
not be possible using traditional methods of radio and
television technology (Jane's Military Communications
1978). By 1982, GTE Sylvania (Needham Heights,
Massachusetts) had developed a command control
electronic sub-system for the US Air Force's Ground
Launch Cruise Missiles (GLCM) that would enable military
commanders to monitor and control the missile prior to
launch both in hostile and non-hostile environments. The
system contains six radio subsystems, created with
visible light using a dark beam (not visible) and is
resistant to the disruptions experienced by radio and
television. Dark beams contribute to the formation of
energetic plasma in the atmosphere. This plasma can
become visible as smog or fog. Some has a different
charge than the sun's energy, and accumulates in places
where the sun's energy is absent, like the polar regions in
the winter. When the polar spring occurs, the sun appears
and repels this plasma, contributing to holes in the ozone
layer. This military system is called: Ground Wave
Emergency Network (GWEN). (See The SECOMII
Communication System, by Wayne Olsen, SAND 78-
0391,Sandia Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico,
April 1978.) This innovative emergency radio system was
apparently never implemented in Europe, and exists only
in North America.Orbit Maneuvering System (1981)
Part of the plan to build the SPS space platforms was the
demand for reusable space shuttles, since they could not
afford to keep discarding rockets. The NASA Spacelab 3
Mission of the Space Shuttle made, in 1981, 'a series of
passes over a network of five ground based
observatories' in order to study what happened to the
ionosphere when the Shuttle injected gases into it from
the Orbit Maneuvering System (OMS). They discovered
that they could 'induce ionospheric holes' and began to
experiment with holes made in the daytime, or at night
over Millstone, Connecticut, and Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
They experimented with the effects of 'artificially induced
ionospheric depletions on very low frequency wave
lengths, on equatorial plasma instabilities, and on low
frequency radio astronomical observations over Roberval,
Quebec, Kwajelein, in the Marshall Islands and Hobart,
Tasmania' (Advanced Space Research, Vo1.8, No. 1,
1988).
Innovative Shuttle Experiments (1985)
An innovative use of the Space Shuttle to perform space
physics experiments in earth orbit was launched, using
the OMS injections of gases to 'cause a sudden depletion
in the local plasma concentration, the creation of a so
called ionospheric hole.' This artificially induced plasma
depletion can then be used to investigate other space
phenomena, such as the growth of the plasma
instabilities or the modification of radio propagation paths.
The 47 second OMS burn of July 29, 1985, produced the
largest and most long-lived ionospheric hole to date,
dumping some 830 kg of exhaust into the ionosphere at
sunset. A 6 second, 68 km OMS release above
Connecticut in August 1985, produced an airglow which
covered over 400,000 square km.
During the 1980's, rocket launches globally numbered
about 500 to 600 a year, peaking at 1500 in 1989. There
were many more during the Gulf War. The Shuttle is the
largest of the solid fuel rockets, with twin 45 meter
boosters. All solid fuel rockets release large amounts of
hydrochloric acid in their exhaust, each Shuttle flight
injecting about 75 tons of ozone destroying chlorine into
the stratosphere. Those launched since 1992 inject even
more ozone-destroying chlorine, about 187 tons, into the
stratosphere (which contains the ozone layer).Mighty Oaks (1986)
In April 1986, just before the Chernobyl disaster, the US
had a failed hydrogen test at the Nevada Test Site called
Mighty Oaks. This test, conducted far underground,
consisted of a hydrogen bomb explosion in one chamber,
with a leaded steel door to the chamber, two meters thick,
closing within milliseconds of the blast. The door was to
allow only the first radioactive beam to escape into the
'control room' in which expensive instrumentation was
located. The radiation was to be captured as a weapon
beam. The door failed to close as quickly as planned,
causing the radioactive gases and debris to fill the control
room, destroying millions of dollars worth of equipment.
The experiment was part of a program to develop X-ray
and particle beam weapons. The radioactive releases
from Mighty Oaks were vented, under a 'licensed venting'
and were likely responsible for many of the North
American nuclear fallout reports in May 1986, which were
attributed to the Chernobyl disaster.
Desert Storm (1991)
According to Defense News, April 13 - 19, 1992, the US
deployed an electromagnetic pulse weapon (EMP) in
Desert Storm, designed to mimic the flash of electricity
from a nuclear bomb. The Sandia National Laboratory
had built a 23,000 square meter laboratory on the
Kirkland Air Force Base, 1989, to house the Hermes II
electron beam generator capable of producing 20 Trillion
Watt pulses lasting 20 billionths to 25 billionths of a
second. This X-ray simulator is called a Particle Beam
Fusion Accelerator. A stream of electrons hitting a metal
plate can produce a pulsed X-ray or gamma ray. Hermes
II had produced electron beams since 1974. These
devises were apparently tested during the Gulf War,
although detailed information on them is sparse.
High Frequency Active Auroral Research
Program, HAARP (1993)
The HAARP Program is jointly managed by the US Air
Force and the US Navy, and is based in Gakona, Alaska.
It is designed to 'understand, simulate and control
ionospheric processes that might alter the performance of
communication and surveillance systems.' The HAARP
system intends to beam 3.6 Gigawatts of effective
radiated power of high frequency radio energy into the
ionosphere in order to:Generate extremely low frequency (ELF) waves for
communicating with submerged submarines
Conduct geophysical probes to identify and
characterize natural ionospheric processes so that
techniques can be developed to mitigate or control
them
Generate ionospheric lenses to focus large amounts
of high frequency energy, thus providing a means of
triggering ionospheric processes that potentially
could be exploited for Department of Defense
purposes,
Electron acceleration for infrared (IR) and other
optical emissions which could be used to control
radio wave propagation properties
Generate geomagnetic field aligned ionization to
control the reflection/scattering properties of radio
waves,
Use oblique heating to produce effects on radio
wave propagation, thus broadening the potential
military applications of ionospheric enhancement
technology.
Poker Flat Rocket Launch (1968 to Present)
The Poker Flat Research Range is located about 50 km
North of Fairbanks, Alaska, and it was established in
1968. It is operated by the Geophysical Institute with the
University of Alaska Fairbanks, under NASA contract.
About 250 major rocket launches have taken place from
this site, and in 1994, a 16 meter long rocket was
launched to help NASA 'understand chemical reactions in
the atmosphere associated with global climate change.'
Similar experiments, but using Chemical Release
Modules (CRM), have been launched from Churchill,
Manitoba. In 1980, Brian Whelan's 'Project Waterhole'
disrupted an aurora borealis, bringing it to a temporary
halt. In February 1983, the chemical released into the
ionosphere caused an aurora borealis over Churchill. In
March 1989, two Black Brant X's and two Nike Orion
rockets were launched over Canada, releasing barium at
high altitudes and creating artificial clouds. These
Churchill artificial clouds were observed from as far away
as Los Alamos, New Mexico.
The US Navy has also been carrying on High Power
Auroral Stimulation (HIPAS) research in Alaska. Through
a series of wires and a 15 meter antenna, they have
beamed high intensity signals into the upper atmosphere,
generating a controlled disturbance in the ionosphere. As
early as 1992, the Navy talked of creating 10 kilometerlong antennas in the sky to generate extremely low
frequency (ELF) waves needed for communicating with
submarines. Another purpose of these experiments is to
study the Aurora Borealis, called by some an outdoor
plasma lab for studying the principles of fusion. Shuttle
flights are now able to generate auroras with an electron
beam. On November 10, 1991, and aurora borealis
appeared in the Texas sky for the first time ever recorded,
and it was seen by people as far away as Ohio and Utah,
Nebraska and Missouri. The sky contained 'Christmas
colors' and various scientists were quick to blame it on
solar activity. However, when pressed most would admit
that the ionosphere must have been weakened at the
time, so that the electrically charged particle hitting the
earth's atmosphere created the highly visible light called
airglow. These charged particles are normally pulled
northwards by the earth's magnetic forces, to the
magnetic north pole. The Northern Lights, as the aurora
borealis is called, normally occurs in the vortex at the
pole where the energetic particles, directed by the
magnetic force lines, are directed.
Conclusions
It would be rash to assume that HAARP is an isolated
experiment which would not be expanded. It is related to
fifty years of intensive and increasingly destructive
programs to understand and control the upper
atmosphere.
It would be rash not to associate HAARP with the space
laboratory construction which is separately being planned
by the United States. HAARP is an integral part of a long
history of space research and development of a
deliberate military nature.
The military implications of combining these projects is
alarming.
Basic to this project is control of communications, both
disruption and reliability in hostile environments. The
power wielded by such control is obvious.
The ability of the HAARP / Spacelab/ rocket combination
to deliver very large amount of energy, comparable to a
nuclear bomb, anywhere on earth via laser and particle
beams, are frightening.
The project is likely to be 'sold' to the public as a space
shield against incoming weapons, or, for the more
gullible, a devise for repairing the ozone layer.Further References:
