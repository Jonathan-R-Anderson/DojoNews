Profile of the Sociopath

This website summarizes some of the common features of descriptions of the behavior of sociopaths.


    Glibness and Superficial Charm

    Manipulative and Conning
    They never recognize the rights of others and see their self-serving behaviors as permissible. They appear to be charming, yet are covertly hostile and domineering, seeing their victim as merely an instrument to be used. They may dominate and humiliate their victims.

    Grandiose Sense of Self
    Feels entitled to certain things as 'their right.'

    Pathological Lying
    Has no problem lying coolly and easily and it is almost impossible for them to be truthful on a consistent basis. Can create, and get caught up in, a complex belief about their own powers and abilities. Extremely convincing and even able to pass lie detector tests.

    Lack of Remorse, Shame or Guilt
    A deep seated rage, which is split off and repressed, is at their core. Does not see others around them as people, but only as targets and opportunities. Instead of friends, they have victims and accomplices who end up as victims. The end always justifies the means and they let nothing stand in their way.

    Shallow Emotions
    When they show what seems to be warmth, joy, love and compassion it is more feigned than experienced and serves an ulterior motive. Outraged by insignificant matters, yet remaining unmoved and cold by what would upset a normal person. Since they are not genuine, neither are their promises.

    Incapacity for Love

    Need for Stimulation
    Living on the edge. Verbal outbursts and physical punishments are normal. Promiscuity and gambling are common.

    Callousness/Lack of Empathy
    Unable to empathize with the pain of their victims, having only contempt for others' feelings of distress and readily taking advantage of them.

    Poor Behavioral Controls/Impulsive Nature
    Rage and abuse, alternating with small expressions of love and approval produce an addictive cycle for abuser and abused, as well as creating hopelessness in the victim. Believe they are all-powerful, all-knowing, entitled to every wish, no sense of personal boundaries, no concern for their impact on others.

    Early Behavior Problems/Juvenile Delinquency
    Usually has a history of behavioral and academic difficulties, yet 'gets by' by conning others. Problems in making and keeping friends; aberrant behaviors such as cruelty to people or animals, stealing, etc.

    Irresponsibility/Unreliability
    Not concerned about wrecking others' lives and dreams. Oblivious or indifferent to the devastation they cause. Does not accept blame themselves, but blames others, even for acts they obviously committed.

    Promiscuous Sexual Behavior/Infidelity
    Promiscuity, child sexual abuse, rape and sexual acting out of all sorts.

    Lack of Realistic Life Plan/Parasitic Lifestyle
    Tends to move around a lot or makes all encompassing promises for the future, poor work ethic but exploits others effectively.

    Criminal or Entrepreneurial Versatility
    Changes their image as needed to avoid prosecution. Changes life story readily. 

Other Related Qualities:

    Contemptuous of those who seek to understand them
    Does not perceive that anything is wrong with them
    Authoritarian
    Secretive
    Paranoid
    Only rarely in difficulty with the law, but seeks out situations where their tyrannical behavior will be tolerated, condoned, or admired
    Conventional appearance
    Goal of enslavement of their victim(s)
    Exercises despotic control over every aspect of the victim's life
    Has an emotional need to justify their crimes and therefore needs their victim's affirmation (respect, gratitude and love)
    Ultimate goal is the creation of a willing victim
    Incapable of real human attachment to another
    Unable to feel remorse or guilt
    Extreme narcissism and grandiose
    May state readily that their goal is to rule the world 


(The above traits are based on the psychopathy checklists of H. Cleckley and R. Hare.)


NOTE: In the 1830's this disorder was called 'moral insanity.' By 1900 it was changed to 'psychopathic personality.' More recently it has been termed 'antisocial personality disorder' in the DSM-III and DSM-IV. Some critics have complained that, in the attempt to rely only on 'objective' criteria, the DSM has broadened the concept to include too many individuals. The APD category includes people who commit illegal, immoral or self-serving acts for a variety of reasons and are not necessarily psychopaths.


DSM-IV Definition

Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a lack of regard for the moral or legal standards in the local culture. There is a marked inability to get along with others or abide by societal rules. Individuals with this disorder are sometimes called psychopaths or sociopaths.

Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-IV)

1. Since the age of fifteen there has been a disregard for and violation of the right's of others, those right's considered normal by the local culture, as indicated by at least three of the following:
    A. Repeated acts that could lead to arrest.
    B. Conning for pleasure or profit, repeated lying, or the use of aliases.
    C. Failure to plan ahead or being impulsive.
    D. Repeated assaults on others.
    E. Reckless when it comes to their or others safety.
    F. Poor work behavior or failure to honor financial obligations.
    G. Rationalizing the pain they inflict on others.

2. At least eighteen years in age.

3. Evidence of a Conduct Disorder, with its onset before the age of fifteen.

4. Symptoms not due to another mental disorder.


Antisocial Personality Disorder Overview (Written by Derek Wood, RN, BSN, PhD Candidate)

Antisocial Personality Disorder results in what is commonly known as a Sociopath. The criteria for this disorder require an ongoing disregard for the rights of others, since the age of 15 years. Some examples of this disregard are reckless disregard for the safety of themselves or others, failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors, deceitfulness such as repeated lying or deceit for personal profit or pleasure, and lack of remorse for actions that hurt other people in any way. Additionally, they must have evidenced a Conduct Disorder before the age of 15 years, and must be at least 18 years old to receive this diagnosis.

People with this disorder appear to be charming at times, and make relationships, but to them, these are relationships in name only. They are ended whenever necessary or when it suits them, and the relationships are without depth or meaning, including marriages. They seem to have an innate ability to find the weakness in people, and are ready to use these weaknesses to their own ends through deceit, manipulation, or intimidation, and gain pleasure from doing so.

They appear to be incapable of any true emotions, from love to shame to guilt. They are quick to anger, but just as quick to let it go, without holding grudges. No matter what emotion they state they have, it has no bearing on their future actions or attitudes.

They rarely are able to have jobs that last for any length of time, as they become easily bored, instead needing constant change. They live for the moment, forgetting the past, and not planning the future, not thinking ahead what consequences their actions will have. They want immediate rewards and gratification. There currently is no form of psychotherapy that works with those with antisocial personality disorder, as those with this disorder have no desire to change themselves, which is a prerequisite. No medication is available either. The only treatment is the prevention of the disorder in the early stages, when a child first begins to show the symptoms of conduct disorder.


THE PSYCHOPATH NEXT DOOR (Source: http://chericola57.tripod.com/infinite.html)

Psychopath. We hear the word and images of Bernardo, Manson and Dahmer pop into our heads; no doubt Ted Bundy too. But they're the bottom of the barrel -- most of the two million psychopaths in North America aren't murderers. They're our friends, lovers and co-workers. They're outgoing and persuasive, dazzling you with charm and flattery. Often you aren't even aware they've taken you for a ride -- until it's too late.

Psychopaths exhibit a Jekyll and Hyde personality. 'They play a part so they can get what they want,' says Dr. Sheila Willson, a Toronto psychologist who has helped victims of psychopaths. The guy who showers a woman with excessive attention is much more capable of getting her to lend him money, and to put up with him when he strays. The new employee who gains her co-workers' trust has more access to their chequebooks. And so on. Psychopaths have no conscience and their only goal is self-gratification. Many of us have been their victims -- at work, through friendships or relationships -- and not one of us can say, 'a psychopath could never fool me.'

Think you can spot one? Think again. In general, psychopaths aren't the product of broken homes or the casualties of a materialistic society. Rather they come from all walks of life and there is little evidence that their upbringing affects them. Elements of a psychopath's personality first become evident at a very early age, due to biological or genetic factors. Explains Michael Seto, a psychologist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental health in Toronto, by the time that a person hits their late teens, the disorder is almost certainly permanent. Although many clinicians use the terms psychopath and sociopath interchangeably, writes psychopath expert Robert Hare on his book 'Without Conscience', a sociopath's criminal behavior is shaped by social forces and is the result of a dysfunctional environment.

Psychopaths have only a shallow range of emotions and lack guilt, says Hare. They often see themselves as victims, and lack remorse or the ability to empathize with others. 'Psychopaths play on the fact that most of us are trusting and forgiving people,' adds Seto. The warning signs are always there; it's just difficult to see them because once we trust someone, the friendship becomes a blinder.

Even lovers get taken for a ride by psychopaths. For a psychopath, a romantic relationship is just another opportunity to find a trusting partner who will buy into the lies. It's primarily why a psychopath rarely stays in a relationship for the long term, and often is involved with three or four partners at once, says Willson. To a psychopath, everything about a relationship is a game. Willson refers to the movie 'Sliding Doors' to illustrate her point. In the film, the main character comes home early after just having been fired from her job. Only moments ago, her boyfriend has let another woman out the front door. But in a matter of minutes he is the attentive and concerned boyfriend, taking her out to dinner and devoting the entire night to comforting her. All the while he's planning to leave the next day on a trip with the other woman.

The boyfriend displays typical psychopathic characteristics because he falsely displays deep emotion toward the relationship, says Willson. In reality, he's less concerned with his girlfriend's depression than with making sure she's clueless about the other woman's existence. In the romance department, psychopaths have an ability to gain your affection quickly, disarming you with words, intriguing you with grandiose plans. If they cheat you'll forgive them, and one day when they've gone too far, they'll leave you with a broken heart (and an empty wallet). By then they'll have a new player for their game.

The problem with their game is that we don't often play by their rules. Where we might occasionally tell a white lie, a psychopath's lying is compulsive. Most of us experience some degree of guilt about lying, preventing us from exhibiting such behavior on a regular basis. 'Psychopaths don't discriminate who it is they lie to or cheat,' says Seto. 'There's no distinction between friend, family and sucker.'

No one wants to be the sucker, so how do we prevent ourselves from becoming close friends or getting into a relationship with a psychopath? It's really almost impossible, say Seto and Willson. Unfortunately, laments Seto, one way is to become more suspicious and less trusting of others. Our tendency is to forgive when we catch a loved one in a lie. 'Psychopaths play on this fact,' he says. 'However, I'm certainly not advocating a world where if someone lies once or twice, you never speak to them again.' What you can do is look at how often someone lies and how they react when caught. Psychopaths will lie over and over again, and where other people would sincerely apologize, a psychopath may apologize but won't stop.

Psychopaths also tend to switch jobs as frequently as they switch partners, mainly because they don't have the qualities to maintain a job for the long haul. Their performance is generally erratic, with chronic absences, misuse of company resources and failed commitments. Often they aren't even qualified for the job and use fake credentials to get it. Seto talks of a patient who would get marketing jobs based on his image; he was a presentable and charming man who layered his conversations with educational and occupational references. But it became evident that the man hadn't a clue what he was talking about, and was unable to hold down a job.

How do you make sure you don't get fooled when you're hiring someone to baby-sit your child or for any other job? Hire based on reputation and not image, says Willson. Check references thoroughly. Psychopaths tend to give vague and inconsistent replies. Of course the best way to solve this problem would be to cure psychopaths of their 'illness.' But there's no recipe for treating them, say psychiatrists. Today's traditional methods of psychotherapy (psychoanalysis, group and one-on-one therapy) and drug treatments have failed. Therapy is more likely to work when an individual admits there's a problem and wants to change. The common problem with psychopaths, says Sets, 'Is they don't see a problem with their behavior.'

Psychopaths don't seek therapy willingly, says Seto. Rather, they're pushed into it by a desperate relative or by a court order. To a psychopath, a therapist is just one more person who must be conned, and the psychopath plays the part right until the therapist is convinced of his or her 'rehabilitation.'

Even though we can't treat psychopaths effectively with therapy, it doesn't mean we can't protect ourselves, writes Hare. Willson agrees, citing the most important factor in keeping psychopaths at bay is to know your vulnerabilities. We need to 'realize our own potential and maximize our strengths' so that our insecurities don't overcome us. Because, she says, a psychopath is a chameleon who becomes 'an image of what you haven't done for yourself.' Over time, she says, 'their appearance of perfection will begin to crack,' but by that time you will have been emotionally and perhaps financially scathed. There comes a time when you realize there's no point in searching for answers; the only thing is to move on.

Taken in part from MW -- By Caroline Konrad -- September 1999

THE MALIGNANT PERSONALITY:

These people are mentally ill and extremely dangerous! The following precautions will help to protect you from the destructive acts of which they are capable.

First, to recognize them, keep the following guidelines in mind.

(1) They are habitual liars. They seem incapable of either knowing or telling the truth about anything.

(2) They are egotistical to the point of narcissism. They really believe they are set apart from the rest of humanity by some special grace.

(3) They scapegoat; they are incapable of either having the insight or willingness to accept responsibility for anything they do. Whatever the problem, it is always someone else's fault.

(4) They are remorselessly vindictive when thwarted or exposed.

(5) Genuine religious, moral, or other values play no part in their lives. They have no empathy for others and are capable of violence. Under older psychological terminology, they fall into the category of psychopath or sociopath, but unlike the typical psychopath, their behavior is masked by a superficial social facade.

If you have come into conflict with such a person or persons, do the following immediately!

(1) Notify your friends and relatives of what has happened.

Do not be vague. Name names, and specify dates and circumstances. Identify witnesses if possible and provide supporting documentation if any is available.

(2) Inform the police. The police will do nothing with this information except to keep it on file, since they are powerless to act until a crime has been committed. Unfortunately, that often is usually too late for the victim. Nevertheless, place the information in their hands.

Obviously, if you are assaulted or threatened before witnesses, you can get a restraining order, but those are palliative at best.

(3) Local law enforcement agencies are usually under pressure if wealthy or politically powerful individuals are involved, so include state and federal agencies as well and tell the locals that you have. In my own experience, one agency that can help in a pinch is the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service or (in Canada) Victims Services at your local police unit. It is not easy to think of the IRS as a potential friend, but a Swedish study showed that malignant types (the Swedes called them bullies) usually commit some felony or other by the age of twenty. If the family is wealthy, the fact may never come to light, but many felonies involve tax evasion, and in such cases, the IRS is interested indeed. If large amounts of money are involved, the IRS may solve all your problems for you. For obvious reasons the Drug Enforcement Agency may also be an appropriate agency to approach. The FBI is an important agency to contact, because although the FBI does not have jurisdiction over murder or assault, if informed, they do have an active interest in any other law enforcement agencies that do not follow through with an honest investigation and prosecution should a murder occur. Civil rights are involved at that point. No local crooked lawyer, judge, or corrupt police official wants to be within a country mile if that comes to light! It is in such cases that wealthy psychopaths discover just how firm the 'friends' they count on to cover up for them really are! Even some of the drug cartel biggies will scuttle for cover if someone picks up the brick their thugs hide under. Exposure is bad for business.

(4) Make sure that several of your friends have the information in the event something happens to you. That way, an appropriate investigation will follow if you are harmed. Don't tell other people who has the information, because then something bad could happen to them as well. Instruct friends to take such an incident to the newspapers and other media.

Brainwave entrainment can be demonstrated electroencephalographically when subjects are in the vicinity of oscillations in the frequency range of approximately 3 to 20 Hz at intensities of below 100 nanoteslas. (1 tesla = 104 gauss)

ELF fields of 6.67 Hz, 6.26 Hz and lower tend to produce symptoms of confusion, anxiety, depression, tension, fear, mild nausea and headaches, cholinergia, arthritic-like aches, insomnia, extended reaction times, hemispheric EEG desynchronization, and many other vegetative disturbances.

H and B field (magnetic vector) oscillations of 7.8, 8.O and 9 Hz produce anxiety-relieving and stress-reducing effects mimicking some 'meditative' states. It has been speculated that frequencies in this range may be the universally permeating 'clock frequencies' or carriers on which 'mind' or 'consciousness' states can be impressed and interact with other life-forms in the nebulous realms of ESP, psychotronics, distant healing, radiesthesia, and related paranormal but anecdotal phenomena.

Coherent ELF energies have the unique and interesting property of almost lossless propagation within the earth-ionosphere cavity waveguide, and attenuation of these signals due to distance from transmitter sites is negligible. Power losses are O.8 db per Mm (million meters) . The magnetic vectors, unlike electrical ( E-wave) components, permeate any substance and cannot be effectively shielded, even by iron, mu-metal, lead, copper, 'Faraday cages', etc.

The established physics of radio propagation therefore suggests that vast geographical areas can be readily mood-manipulated by transmissions of EM energy within the earth-ionosphere cavity wave guide. The accidental discovery in 1938 of the 'Luxembourg Effect', by which a transmitter of relatively low power, fed to an antenna array producing a circularly-polarized signal, can 'piggy-back' to any preexisting RF energy source and produce disturbances of the ionosphere at any frequency desired (which then 'modulates' all other energies within that 'waveguide' is fully described in the literature of 40 years ago but probably forgotten or overlooked by today's technologists. 
  
 

HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

My personal interest in EEG and consciousness dates to 1969 when I became fascinated with the (re)discoveries of Joe Kamiya and the conscious control of brainwaves via biofeedback. I developed sensitive and reliable monopolar instrumentation for this purpose under the Alpha-Metrics trademark.

In the course of traveling, lecturing, teaching classes and demonstrating this EEG equipment, and because one of my personal interests was in parapsychology and consciousness research, I had the unique opportunity (and reliable instrumentation at hand) to make electroencephalographic recordings of the brain wave patterns of a number of truly exceptional subjects in the U.S and Hawaii who were famous or who had demonstrated established reputations as psychics , healers , medicine-men , dowsers, etc.

Since I had a wealth of personal contacts in both the 'scientific' establishment and 'psychic underground' communities, I was fortunate for the opportunity of meeting and being allowed to wire up and instrument a cross-section of 'sensitives' from vastly different disciplines, ranging from charismatic Christian faith healers, to an authentic Hawaiian Kahuna, to practitioners of Wicca, hex, Santaria, radiesthesia-radionics, seers, ESP 'readers', psychics, etc., etc.

A striking number of these authentic 'sensitives' exhibited a nearly identical EEG signature when reporting that they were in their 'working' state of consciousness, a state persisting from one to several seconds intermittently during the 'altered state of consciousness' phase of the paranormal activity. The signal appeared to be an almost pure sine-wave of up to 25 microvolts as read MONOPOLAR, frontal to occipital, midline; and 7.8 to 8.0 Hz in frequency; or on the 'alpha-theta' borderline.

This serendipitous discovery was unexpected, in that although the subjects were practicing opposing disciplines, and coming from totally disparate teachings and viewpoints, and would barely acknowledge the existence or authenticity of practitioners outside of their belief system, they all appeared to be 'marching to the sound of the same cosmic drummer' when in an altered state of consciousness.

After replicating this observation a number of times at sites thousands of miles apart, the obvious question arose that if these exceptional people, unbeknown to each other, were falling into the same 'cosmic consciousness' mode, what or where was the signal to which their brain waves became entrained? What was the 'drummer'? Is there a 'clock' or 'synchronizing' signal present?

In 1952, physicist W. O. Schumann postulated mathematically that our earth and ionosphere constituted a cavity wave guide whose physical constants and magnetic field would oscillate at a resonant frequency identical to the range of human brain waves. In 1962, our National Bureau of Standards division' of Radio Propagation reported the actual physical detection and instrumental recordings of these signals; and as predicted, tracings were indistinguishable from encephalographic recordings from human brain waves. This newly-discovered phenomenon was dubbed 'earth brain wave'.

Since there is a pronounced node in these 'Schumann Resonances' at 7.8 - 8.O Hz, the question of possible EEG and ELF interconnectedness appears to be a irresistible area for investigation.

In 1973 a professional coil fabricator duplicated the 'Schumann' pick-up described on page 313 in the Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards, Division of Radio Propagation, Vol 66D No.3 May-June 1962, and I perfected an extremely low noise, highly-filtered amplifier capable of recording and displaying the naturally-occurring magnetic oscillations surrounding our biosphere. 
 

My intention was to re-contact as many of the 'sensitive' subjects from my first study as feasible, and this time make simultaneous EEG and ELF records and compare the signals for frequency and phase coherency. This was done on a more limited scale than in the original phase of investigations. In a few instances, careful analysis revealed episodes of absolute entrainment during the brief seconds when sensitives reported being in their altered states of consciousness. Unexpected variables emerged, such as reliability factors dependent on lunar phases and time of day.

This study was extended to test the theory that if a very small percentage of subjects, by virtue of hereditary factors, or religious or metaphysical discipline, or meditative practices, had sensitized some portion of their minds or brains to act as an extremely sensitive ' dual-conversion superheterodyne receiver'; would it be possible to remotely sense, amplify, and display this real-time 'drummer' to less sensitive subjects whose heads were as unresponsive and un-selective as a crystal set, so that they too could mimic the highly organized 'psychic' abilities of the trained 'seer'?

Late in 1973, apparatus was built for pulsing a miniature lamp held in an empty eyeglass frame as a real-time photic stimulus that would cause an evoked potential in step with the ELF 'cosmic drummer'. This was moderately promising, but marginally successful because of the individually variable delay-llne (of about 100 milliseconds) between the onset of the stimulus and its response.

The next effort at inducing psychic awareness was to place a 9 ft. diameter coil of about 100 turns of #28 magnet wire on the floor of the laboratory, and expose subjects to the real-time magnetic replica of the highly-amplified 'Schumann' signal sensed at a remote location to avoid feedback. Results with individuals and groups experiencing this 'magic circle' were dramatically successful. The third generation investigations were extended to determine if subjects brainwaves could be influenced by artificially generated magnetic oscillations of sine-waves of low intensity and at specific frequencies within the ranges occurring naturally.

Some subjects exhibited absolute brainwave entrainment over the range of approximately 6 to 14 Hz and at signal strengths of approximately 100 nanoteslas.  Onset of phase/frequency lock-on averaged from one second to four seconds from the time of switching on the artificial ELF generator, and would sometimes last for the duration of the stimulus, usually 10 second episodes.

One subject (Mr. A.P., aged 54) displayed absolute entrainment when he was placed inside a triple-shielded magnetic (iron) and triple electrostatic (copper) Faraday cage. The artificial ELF stimulus was originating from a pocket-sized battery powered device positioned outside the shielded room and 12 ft. removed from the subject. Tuning the device over a wide frequency range caused subjects EEG to exactly follow the stimulus.

After demonstrating the neurological responses of sensitive individuals, and doing preliminary mapping of subjective states as reported for various specific frequencies (defined to 1/100 Hz on a digital frequency counter attached to the ELF generator), experiments were undertaken on a broader scale with totally unaware subjects, such as customers at local coffee shops during rush hours. This obviated the variables of 'suggestion', 'expectancy' or 'hypnosis'.

Anecdotal data amassed suggesting that a pocket-sized transmitter at power levels of under 100 milliwatts could drastically alter the moods of unsuspecting persons, and that vast geographical areas could be surreptitiously mood manipulated by invisible and remote transmissions of EM energy. Tests were rapid:y abandoned after dramatic proof because of ethical considerations.

It is well known that naturally-occurring earth-ionosphere magnetic oscillations will vary slightly in frequency diurnally, monthly (full vs. new boon), and in definite cycles related to sunspot activity. This may well explain observable 'full moon craziness'.

Resonant frequencies are also affected by earth-venus-mercury-moon-Jupiter-sun gravity vectors. And there is well-documented correlation between these geophysical phenomena and episodes of political unrest, mood alteration, and health cycles; as supported by a vast technical and medical Literature. Our 'Drummer'seems to affect all life-forms.  An excellent reference source of widely unrelated phenomena dramatically tied to our earth's geomagnetic cycles is Peterson's Man. Weather. Sun. cited in the bibliography.

And by artificially amplifying or altering or distorting these geomagnetic fields, or transmitting specific and coherent frequencies, vast segments of earth's populations could be affected. This now becomes an attractive modality of psychological or psionic warfare; or intentional modification of moods that could reflect in areas ranging from time-specific insomnia to stock market fluctuations. (There have been recent epidemics of 4:00 to 5:30 AM 'worry', insomnia coinciding with the 9 Hz 'Schumann' drop-out as observed in journals of geomagnetic research.)

On several occasions within the last few years, our laboratory began detecting wavetrains in the ELF ranges that could not be of natural origin. These may or may not be related to recent Soviet transmissions of radio energy spread over broad segments of the frequency spectrum ranging up to 28 MHz. Danish monitoring stations report that peak powers of these signals are on the order of 40 megawatts. Transmitters are presumably located near Riga or Gomel. Transmissions have disrupted lawful radio communications throughout the world, and have been protested by many nations. The Soviets have not given an adequate explanation of the purpose of these tests. An early supposition assumed Soviet experiments with over-the horizon radar. Perhaps the psychoactive EM components are unexpected side-effects of this new technology.

Canadian Department of Transport monitoring sources have established that spectrum analysis of these strange signals appear to be higher harmonics of a fundamental frequency of 6.67 Hz. (The Tesla fo) . The signals are modulated with pulses with repetition rates of 5 to 15 pulses per second, usually 10 Hz.

Besides modifying the electrical, ionic, and stratospheric jet stream equilibrium weather-motion factors, the signals fall precisely within the windows known to be psychoactive.

The Canadians report alarming mood-alterations in certain areas of Eastern Canada, such as near Timmins and Kirkland Lake, Ontario, which observers believe are linked to Soviet transmissions.

Since both theory and laboratory tests prove that magnetic (H-wave) shielding is impossible at these psycho-active frequencies, even with highly sophisticated multiple iron or mu-metal shielding, it can be speculated that ELF signals can be a powerful potential weapon with global capabilities in psycho-physiological warfare. (The wavelength of an 8 Hz signal is 22,159 miles).

I feel that tests should be undertaken with a number of remote ELF sensors that can be made directional in order to establish by triangulation the sources of these recently detected manmade disturbances, whether originating from offshore or domestically. ELF data should be correlated with data monitored from Soviet transmissions that can be detected on commercial short-wave receivers. These two modalities can be in turn correlated with human or animal EEG recordings. (Note: this was done 5/25/78 with positive correlations; R.C.B.)

ELF as a modality for mood-manipulation is a demonstrated reality. And there is a strong possibility that it has been implemented since 1975 by the Soviets, intentionally or accidentally as an unpredicted side effect of local standing waves or re-radiation of power lines.

This speculation is being explored currently by a network of independent scientists working in the disciplines of psychophysiology, geophysics. radio propagation, pharmacology, physics, electronics, and psychotherapy.

A bibliography of pertinent medical and technical articles and books is attached to this report.

Possible countermeasure proposals embrace psychopharmacology, adaptive desensitization, and the utilization of personal low-powered (milliwatt) magnetic oscillators which by the law of inverse-square will override hostile signals, man made or natural, with beneficial frequencies.

An interesting device of this nature with possible 'countermeasure' capabilities is the 'Vitasette' instrument designed by W. Ludwlg for limited distribution and testing in West Germany. One model of this device is the size of a cigarette lighter and has a claimed battery life of two years. Frequencies are user programmable over the range of 1.25 to 19 Hz by activating specific combinations of switches. This ' transmitter' generates spike-wave pulses when a mu-metal core of extremely high permeability is driven to beyond saturation with a single transistor and coil.

Effective range is claimed to be about one meter. This is sufficient to insure proper synchronization of the wearer 's biological clocks' , circadian rhythms, and possible coherency of left and right hemisphere neuronal firings. Ludwig claims cures for a broad spectrum of vegetative disturbances

Similar to the characteristics of a frequency-modulation discriminator (Foster-Seeley) the brain cells appear to 'latch' to the highest amplitude pulses in their proximity, and unlike 'A.M.' detectors, will reject background noise and pulses of lower intensity. The analogy would be that a small transistor radio held up to a listener's ear would drown out a nearby rock-muslc band with thousands of watts of audio amplification.  Similarly, a milliwatt device worn on the body could override a hostile transmission of megawatt power at a distance.

While almost everyone is familiar with electronic 'heart pacers' capable of insuring proper heart rhythms, few are aware of recent research establishing that brainwaves and other biological functions can be influenced at great distances by magnetic pulses of critical frequencies.

There is promise that such devices, when tuned to highly specific 'beneficial' rates, could be of value in stress-modification, tension and anxiety relief, dyslexia; psychotherapy, insomnia, 'confusion' states if caused by left and right hemisphere desynchronization, headaches, sexual dysfunction, and many other conditions. However, much like the initial application of atomic energy, the first large-scale implementations of ELF discoveries appear to be destructive.

I invite other interested investigators to replicate and verify my observations. 
A brief disclosure of my procedures follows.

A human subject, selected for sensitivity, is wired to a battery-powered, totally isolated EEG amplifier. The output is recorded on one or more channels of chart, or (preferably) fed as an FM/VCO to channel(s) of magnetic tape. Monopolar electrodes were frontal to occipital, midline.

Simultaneously, but with electrical or optical isolation sufficient to eliminate cross-talk, the output of a magnetic-signal detector (Schumann coil) is chartrecorded or fed to its separate magnetic tape channel.

The 'Schumann' coils typically consist of 50,000 to 250,000 turns of #38 magnet wire wound on a ferrite, soft-iron, or mu-metal core. Coil axis is oriented to magnetic N-5 and connected to a separate amplifier having a bandpass of 2-40 Hz, a noise figure capable of seeing O.1 micro-volt rms at 10 k ohms, and 100 db. or better rejection of frequencies of 60 Hz and higher.

With proper subjects, phase and frequency EEG 'lock-ons' can be easily observed by inspecting the chart recordings, or if measurements are made in the field, by later observation of the magnetic tape records after signal recovery on paper charts or dual-trace storage scopes (Tektronlx 214).

My initial transmitter of ELF signals consisted of a phase-shift, pure sine-wave oscillator whose output was fed to a 10 Hy soft iron core inductance of 1200 ohm dc resistance. Power level was 9 volts at O.7 ma, or 6.3 milliwatts. This device could cause EEG modification and mood alteratlon in subjects at up to 10 ft. A higher power device constructed in 1973 provided greater effective range, as was expected. Highly specific modulating and carrier frequencies must obviously be withheld for fear of potential mis-use, as are 'keyhole' and waveform data, also details of the multiple-source devices producing ' soliton' ELF magnetic standing waves.

My investigations began in 1970 . Early research In consciousness-modification by external non-chemical stimulus was undertaken in the following areas.

Photic stimulation of the subjects by miniature lamps, both cold-cathode (phosphors) and filament, and 'strobe'. These light sources were either driven by oscillators or by the subject's amplified brainwaves in real time and later) with delayed and phase-modified pulses to 'pump' EEG's.

Exposure of subjects to voltage-gradient oscillating fields, and electrostatic (modulated) fields.

Exposure of subjects to pulse-modulated negative ion generators, typically (-)20 kv dc sources of corona discharge modulated by mechanically rotating screen-shields or by carefully adjusted spark gaps that would arc over and short the output at frequencies centering on the 8 Hz. range.

Exposure of subjects to actinic stimulus of nearly monochromatic red-green-blue pulses of light through a fiber-optic display device, held close to the left or right eye. Phase and frequency of each channel was selectively varied in efforts to excite red-green-blue rod and cone receptors independently and evoke 'standing wave' potentials in specific sites of the occipital cortex. By selective excitation of both eyes with delayed pulses, evoked 'standing waves' occurred.

Audible ' click' stimulus was explored, as were infrasonics , ultrasonics (28 k Hz) and phase-shifted sound fed to left and right ears.  Audio-modulated 100 kHz electrostatic fields were tested.

In two series of tests, the amplified, filtered, and clipped ( about 200 mv) real-time 'Schumann' signals were fed directly to the head via surface electrodes. This approach was dramatically psychoactive, and abandoned in 1974 as dangerous aftersubjects experienced 'LSD' type visions.

At this time, we prefer SINUSOIDAL (not pulsed, triangular, square, saw-toothed, etc.) waveforms. Fundamental frequencies are psychoactive, but can be enhanced by audio-modulating them onto compound carrier frequencies, hetrodyning multiple sources, generating 'soliton' waves; etc.

We feel that much data has been overlooked by other researchers not specifying the precise frequencies under investigation to accuracies of .01 to .001 Hz. There is evidence that long-chain molecules near liquid-crystal boundaries may simulate coherent dipole arrays with very high Qs. Biological signals are after all at the opposite end of the electromagnetic spectrum where communications frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands are specified to .005% and better.

These investigations have been undertaken privately as a personal interest by the author. They have been totally funded by myself, and are in no way connected with any outside interests, either governmental or commercial.

Results have been reported on an informal basis via limited personal communications with other interested parties. Highly specific frequency and advanced waveform data are proprietary.

Precise technical details on low-noise biological and geomagnetic amplifiers, filters, Schumann detector coils (now into our forth-generation devices), practical and inexpensive voltage-controlled oscillator and F.M. discriminator circuits for cassette tape recording of ELF and EEG signals and data, practical and inexpensive modifications to digital frequency counters extending their ranges to 1/100 Hz, suggestions for recording and displaying and analyzing these signals, etc., etc., can be made available to other serious and informed research workers who have a responsible interest in this subject. We feel it wise to withhold only the data on hemispheric desynchronization frequencies.

The instruments and hardware used in this study can be made available for inspection and evaluation.

Emphasis in this report on ELF magnetic phenomena rather than details of results of related psychoactive modalities is based on the conclusion that the physics and propagation characteristics make this the most viable choice of technically feasible global mood manipulation.">
