    <p>Happy Miracle is dedicated to make everyone's life better. So, starting 2/6/2013 we are starting the "Better Life Initiative". Giving free living space to abandoned, hungry, abused children all around the world. We are determined to give these children a life they could only dream of. A freedom from the screams of their past life. We will serve as parents, friends, protectors, and lawyers. We will do whatever it takes to give these children and teens a Better Life.</p>
    
    <p>Did you know that nearly 1 in 30 kids are on the streets? Nearly 2.5 million of them. All alone. You can help fix that. Donate to Happy Miracle and we will send you a complimentary post card with a photo of the kid you gave a better life.</p>
