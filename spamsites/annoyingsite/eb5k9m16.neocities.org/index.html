<h3> on a completely unrelated note, I am single and looking to mingle, I am aware this isn't a dating site i'm just throwing it out there I am accepting partner applications due to me being maidenless, manless, and overall partnerless and alone. Though I can confirm I am satisfied living the single lady life.
