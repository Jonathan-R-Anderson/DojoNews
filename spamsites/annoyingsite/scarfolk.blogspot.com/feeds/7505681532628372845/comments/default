This was unfounded as he was given an alibi by Mayor Ritter between the hours of 3 &amp;amp; 5 am on the night of the said painting. Ritter&amp;#39;s alibi was given by nature that he had chaired the annual Benefit announcers conference in the asbestos recycling centre, temporarily located in the kindergarten assembly hall, ( due to the annual infection programme) no minutes were kept as the tradition was that these should be shared mutually via simple olfactory methods, eg the wearing of heavily perfumed lead based personal hygiene products.

Earlier in the year, the Class 4 self-propelled child had been approved for use and was due to be rolled out just after the annual sacrifices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Class 3 children were sold as surplus. Aside from the 347 stored as keepsakes, a few were unaccounted for until the Track and Trace programme, where they were tied to the tracks of one of Scarfolk&amp;#39;s outsider-pursuit tanks and traces of what was left were washed away by acid rain.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/6170354112296200777/7505681532628372845/comments/default/6000448502161383863'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/6170354112296200777/7505681532628372845/comments/default/6000448502161383863'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://scarfolk.blogspot.com/2020/07/the-infamous-class-3-school.html?showComment=1595599856343#c6000448502161383863' title=''/><author><name>Chest Rockwell</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/14833707863868215884</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='https://scarfolk.blogspot.com/2020/07/the-infamous-class-3-school.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6170354112296200777.post-7505681532628372845' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6170354112296200777/posts/default/7505681532628372845' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-2088853715"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="24 July 2020 at 15:10"/></entry></feed>
