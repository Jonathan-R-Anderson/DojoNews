  <p> What is Anthropomorphism? </p>
  <p> While it was touched on briefly on the homepage, I didn't really explain it so I hope this will help. </p>
  <p> Anthropomorphism is a word that is supposed to describe something that has humanistic qualities but is not human. It stems off the word anthropomorpic and anthropology, the study of anti-humanoid things. In this case the anthropomorphic creature is 00 (AiRA). Anthropomorphism or Anthro-tech is supposed to be the adventures/discovery of self conciousness, a way to find out how oneself is. While it is a goofy comic it does have some darker themes/meanings so just be aware.</p>
  <p> genres: slice of life/ dark comedy/ romance (probably not possible but ima put it just cuz)/ comedy/ si-fi/ idk bro its a trip fr ðŸ’€ </p>
