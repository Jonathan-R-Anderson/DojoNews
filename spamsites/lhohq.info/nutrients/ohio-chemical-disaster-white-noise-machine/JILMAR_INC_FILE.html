<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  12   convicted based upon his sincere belief, whether or not you

  13   agree with that belief, that his conduct was mandated by his

  14   religion; (c) that the defendant believed that the United

  15   States embassies were legitimate military targets because he

  16   had the sincere belief, as proposed by Usama Bin Laden, that

  17   embassies fulfilled military and intelligence surveillance

  18   functions which furthered the aims of the United States

  19   government and opposed the aims and objectives of Usama Bin

  20   Laden;

  21            (6) that the defendant committed the offenses for

  22   which he has been convicted while young in age;

  23            (7) that the defendant was indoctrinated in

  24   conservative Muslim teachings which promoted jihad and

  25   martyrdom during his early and formative years.



                                                                6671



   1            As you can see, the defense is entitled to present

   2   evidence in mitigation of sentence that consists of a broad

   3   range of information about the defendant Al-'Owhali's

   4   background, record, character and circumstances of defense

   5   which may lead a juror to conclude that the defendant should

   6   not receive the death penalty but instead should be punished

   7   by spending the rest of his life in prison.

   8            Once this process of deciding on the existence of

   9   aggravating and mitigating factors has been completed, each of

  10   you must individually engage in a balancing process in which

  11   you will weigh the aggravating factor or factors, statutory

  12   and nonstatutory, that all 12 jurors have unanimously and

  13   beyond a reasonable doubt found to exist, against any

  14   mitigating factor or factors which you, individually or with

  15   other jurors, have by a preponderance of the evidence found to

  16   exist.

  17            The relevant statute then tells us that after

  18   weighing the aggravating and any mitigating factors, the jury

  19   must "consider whether all the aggravating factor or factors

  20   found to exist sufficiently outweigh all the mitigating factor

  21   or factors found to exist to justify a sentence of death, or,

  22   in the absence of a mitigating factor, whether the aggravating

  23   factor or factors alone are sufficient to justify a sentence

  24   of death."

  25            That's the end of the quotation from the statute.



                                                                6672



   1            In carrying out this weighing and balancing process,

   2   the members of the jury are not mere fact finders.  Jurors are

   3   called upon to make a unique individualized judgment about the

   4   appropriateness of sentencing another human being to death.

   5   This is not a mechanical process.  Neither is the decision

   6   determined by raw numbers.  Members of a death penalty jury do

   7   not simply count factors.  Instead, individual jurors consider

   8   such factors qualitatively, assessing the weight and value of

   9   each factor.  Any one factor proved, if sufficiently serious,

  10   may outweigh several mitigating factors.  On the other hand, a

  11   single mitigating factor may outweigh several aggravating

  12   factors.

  13            In short, what is called for in weighing the varying

  14   factors is not arithmetic but an individual's careful,

  15   considered, and mature judgment.  Again, whether or not the

  16   circumstances in this case justify a sentence of death is a

  17   decision the law leaves entirely to you, and you should not

  18   take anything I may say or do during this phase of the trial

  19   as indicating what I think of the evidence or what I think

  20   your verdict should be.  That is your responsibility.

  21            As I mentioned earlier, you must deliberate and

  22   determine the sentence to each of the capital counts

  23   separately.  You may conclude that aggravating and mitigating

  24   factors should receive different weights in conducting the

  25   separate weighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors



                                                                6673



   1   applicable to each of the capital counts.

   2            As we begin this process, two final points I wish to

   3   make, or perhaps emphasize.  The first, which I mentioned

   4   briefly before, is that you are never required to return a

   5   verdict of death.  The law provides you with guidance in

   6   making a decision but, as stated earlier, your decision on

   7   this question of life or death is a uniquely individual

   8   judgment which the law in the final analysis leaves up to each

   9   of you.

  10            The last thing I wish to explain, to restate, is that

  11   in order to impose a sentence of death, all 12 jurors must

  12   agree that death is the appropriate sentence.  If the jury

  13   does not vote for a sentence of death, then I will impose a

  14   sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of

  15   release.  I have no other sentencing option.

  16            I will repeat and elaborate on these points after you

  17   have heard all of the evidence and before you begin your

  18   deliberations, and, again, as in the prior proceedings, you

  19   will have a special verdict form to assist you.  As I said

  20   earlier, because these procedures are relatively new in our

  21   system of justice, I thought it advisable that you have this

  22   preliminary explanation.  My final and definitive instructions

  23   will be in writing and available to you during your

  24   deliberations.

  25            I thank you for your patience and attention, and we



                                                                6674
