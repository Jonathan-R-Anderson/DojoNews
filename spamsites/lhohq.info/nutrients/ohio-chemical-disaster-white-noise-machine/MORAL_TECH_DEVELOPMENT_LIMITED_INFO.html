  23   A.  He told me, he told me he saw, he saw Bin Laden on CNN in

  24   the CNN interview.  He said that he mentioned things -- now I

  25   recall.  Ibrahim told me.



                                                                852



   1   "Q.  What did he tell you?

   2   "A.  He didn't say any declaration of war or Jihad, he said

   3   that he mentioned, he did not specify what was it.  But he

   4   said he mentioned things he should not speak about at this

   5   time.

   6            "Now I recall that phone call.

   7   "Q.  Abu Ibrahim said that Bin Laden mentioned things that he

   8   should not speak about at this time?

   9   "A.  Yes.

  10   "Q.  Just so we understand the meaning of what you are saying,

  11   was Abu Ibrahim saying Usama Bin Laden said certain things

  12   that should not be talked about, or was Abu Ibrahim saying

  13   that Bin Laden was speaking too openly?

  14   "A.  What I understood is that he said things that does not

  15   serve his purpose right now.

  16   "Q.  So Ibrahim was disagreeing with whether or not Usama Bin

  17   Laden should have said the things that he did say?

  18   "A.  Yes.

  19   "Q.  Was Abu Ibrahim disagreeing because Ibrahim didn't agree

  20   with Usama Bin Laden or because he didn't think Bin Laden

  21   should say it out loud?

  22   "A.  I don't know what he meant, but what came to my mind then

  23   is that Usama Bin Laden said things that should not be said at

  24   that time because it makes him look, it doesn't make him look

  25   good in front of people who are looking at him as an example.



                                                                853



   1   He did not specify what -- because it was a telephone

   2   conversation.

   3   "Q.  Where was Abu Ibrahim when you had the conversation?

   4   "A.  Sudan.

   5   "Q.  Where were you?

   6   "A.  Kenya.

   7   "Q.  Who called whom?

   8   "A.  I called him.

   9   "Q.  Why did you call him?

  10   "A.  There were merchants in Sudan that wanted some ostriches

  11   from Kenya, and he kept asking me to send pictures and

  12   information about ostriches and export ostriches, and all of a

  13   sudden he quit.  I tried to call him, but there were no

  14   connections, so I called Abu Ibrahim and told him to send, to

  15   ask him to call me.

  16            "So then Abu Ibrahim talked to me about this.  He

  17   said, did you hear this thing on CNN?

  18            "I said, no.  He said he was on CNN and he said

  19   things that are not supposed to be said.

  20   "Q.  Did you speak to anyone else about Bin Laden's statements
