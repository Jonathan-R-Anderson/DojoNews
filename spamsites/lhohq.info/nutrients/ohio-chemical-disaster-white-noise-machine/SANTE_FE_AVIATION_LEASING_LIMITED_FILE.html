  20   he identified the picture Government's Exhibit 1300 which was

  21   15 Amani, the place where the passport photo and the passport

  22   application with the fingerprints of Khalfan Khamis Mohamed

  23   was found.  What Mohamed Sultan told you was that the

  24   transaction actually took place at the Al Noor Hotel in Dar es

  25   Salaam, and in particular he identified the room, room 24



                                                                5419



   1   within the Al Noor Hotel.  Remember he said there was a

   2   meeting and they were haggling back and forth about how much

   3   money they had, and there was a knock on the door, and this

   4   mysterious third person showed up with the rest of the money,

   5   and just like the transaction involving the Nairobi bomb

   6   truck, there was no paperwork.  There was no contract.

   7   Mohamed Sultan never got the rest of the paperwork.  You may

   8   remember Fabid Sadaalli was the hotel clerk, and one of the

   9   things he identified was the guest register book, Government's

  10   Exhibit 1457.  If you look inside there, you see at the top

  11   right, 24/7/98.  You will see, if we can go ahead and

  12   highlight that example, there is an entry for Sheik Ahmed, and

  13   you see at the far right, room 24, just like Mr. Sultan

  14   described for you.  Fabid Sadaalli identified this photograph,

  15   Government's Exhibit 123, as Sheik Ahmed, and he remembered

  16   Sheik Ahmed getting visited by Ahmed Khalfan Galani.  As I

  17   mentioned earlier, there was Julius Kisingo, the welder who

  18   did the work, and he identified the picture of Swedan as the

  19   person who asked him to do the welding.  If you look at

  20   Exhibit 1178A on the screen, that is an overhead view of the

  21   diagram of the back of the truck that Julius Kisingo described

  22   for you.  You remember how he took the frame and he described

  23   the two sides that he built along the side of the wall.  He

  24   described the metal shack that we saw, Government's Exhibit

  25   1366, that went along the side of the wall.  What he said was,



                                                                5420



   1   the person he identified as Swedan told him that he wanted

   2   Kisingo to make these frames in the back for fish and that

   3   Mr. Kisingo remembered seeing a spot where a refrigerator unit

   4   of the truck had been but the unit was no longer there but he

   5   could tell that it was once a refrigerator truck.  The other

   6   thing Julius Kisingo described for you was a large battery

   7   frame that he was asked to make.  That is Government's Exhibit

   8   1178B.

   9            One thing to bear in mind, if we can put up on the

  10   left side Government's Exhibit 1178A and if we could rotate

  11   it.  During his interview with the FBI, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed

  12   walks one of the FBI agents through a diagram as it was being

  13   described by Khalfan Khamis as the back of the truck.  Khalfan

  14   Khamis Mohamed described the diagram on the right, 1054, as an

  15   accurate diagram.  If you compare it to the diagram of Julius

  16   Kisingo, you can see, one of the things Julius Kisingo told

  17   you about the holes in the back of the truck, they were marked

  18   before he was asked to do any work and he drilled the holes

  19   where he was told to do so.  You will see that Khalfan Khamis

  20   Mohamed agreed with the agents in that diagram that the

  21   batteries that were used, no doubt the batteries used to

  22   detonate the bomb, were in the back of the truck, and there

  23   was wiring, which of course explained the holes in the back of

  24   the truck, that had to go all the way up to the cab so the

  25   suicide driver could detonate the bomb.
