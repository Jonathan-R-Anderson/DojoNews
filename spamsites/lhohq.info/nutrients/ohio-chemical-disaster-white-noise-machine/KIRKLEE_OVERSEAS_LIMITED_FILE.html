  23   couple of minutes off, and then you see the call to El Hage's

  24   phone in Nairobi, Kenya.

  25            The document, if we go back to the second page of it,



                                                                5599



   1   is signed Abu Suliman.  We can show you the translation of

   2   that.  You see down there at the bottom in Arabic.  We'll pull

   3   that up later.

   4            But when you go back to the document what we'll see

   5   is that there is a reference to, in the letter itself you will

   6   see references to the address of sons Abdallah.  You remember

   7   El Hage goes by, among other names, Abu Abdallah.

   8            There is requests for the refund for the ticket.  We

   9   know from Government Exhibit 437A is one of the things that El

  10   Hage and Suliman were talking about and the other thing is the

  11   letter asks that the recipient give greetings to Harun and to

  12   other people, but it never mentions that the recipient pass

  13   greetings to El Hage, so it mentions the recipient's children

  14   including Abdallah.  It asks for greetings to be send on to

  15   Harun and some others, but not to El Hage.

  16            It's sent to El Hage's fax number in Nairobi and it

  17   has El Hage's fingerprints on it, so when he says he doesn't

  18   know the document, doesn't recognize the document, the

  19   fingerprints disprove that testimony.

  20            Count 294.  This is three specifications.

  21            First.  Do you know any people living in America who

  22   are contacting Usama Bin Laden?

  23   "A.  No.

  24            Specification B.  Has anyone in America ever

  25   contacted you on behalf of Usama Bin Laden?



                                                                5600



   1   "A.  No.

   2            The underlying specification:  Do you know any

   3   contacts of Usama Bin Laden living in Florida?

   4   "A.  No.

   5            Do you know of any contacts -- this is specification

   6   C -- do you know of any contacts of Usama Bin Laden living in

   7   California?

   8   "A.  No.

   9            Well, you know just from the food and beverage

  10   industry letter which is from Ihab Ali who lives in Florida to

  11   Ali Muhammad who lives in California, where he's making

  12   reference to Usama, this is the same person who wrote El Hage

  13   saying, tell Hasir, his older brother, to be careful.  Ihab

  14   Ali living in Florida, that all three of these specifications

  15   are proved to be false.

  16            You know from all of the other correspondence that

  17   we've gone through, Government Exhibits 611, 437, 439, and

  18   615, that there is communication between El Hage and Ihab Ali

  19   in Florida, and you know that from the telephone records we

  20   reviewed, that they are in contact with each other and he

  21   knows that they are contacts of Usama Bin Laden, just from the

  22   context of the letters.

  23            Ali Muhammad, you know he's the person who receives

  24   the investigation report of Abu Ubaida al Ban Shiri, and he is

  25   the person -- there is also telephone records that show



                                                                5601



   1   contact between -- he's the person who is in El Hage house.

   2   He's the person who was working with Kherchtou at the time.

   3            The last count, ladies and gentlemen.  297.  This is
