   5   and sisters around the world, and, if necessary, use armed

   6   struggle.

   7            Make no mistake about it.  I am not saying he's just

   8   out there as some preacher preaching the good of the rest of

   9   the world.  He went there to see whatever he could do, armed

  10   struggle if necessary.  And he was trained for a number of

  11   months, about nine or ten months, in some light weapons there.

  12   And he also studied.  He had religious studies in this

  13   Afghanistan training camp that the government talked about.

  14   He had religious studies.  You know what else did there?  He

  15   played volleyball.  He played soccer.

  16            And there were thousands of others that were trained

  17   over the years during the time he was there and times he was

  18   not there.  In fact, this camp is not just like a very

  19   discrete camp that they have very specific training for a

  20   specific mission, they go out and they commit all these

  21   crimes.  There is sometimes that there was -- you know why

  22   there was no training going on during the camp when he was

  23   there?  Because they didn't even have any facilities.  They

  24   didn't have the weapons.  They didn't have what was necessary

  25   for training to be done.

   1            So at this time during his training in 1994 in these

   2   Afghanistan camps he never even heard of Usama Bin Laden, he

   3   never heard of him, never new of him,didn't know anything

   4   about him.  He heard of other people talking about him.

   5            In 1995 he left the camp and he went back to live in

   6   Dar-es-Salaam.  Now, this is interesting.  When he left the

   7   camp he was told to leave a contact number in case we need you

   8   for something, if it is necessary for you to become a soldier

   9   in the war against whoever.  Leave a number we could reach

  10   you.  Okay?

  11            He did.  He left a number and address where he could

  12   be reached.  He was never called.  Never a letter.  Never a

  13   communication.  No one ever said:  We need you for '94, 95,

  14   '96 and '97.  There was no such contact at all.  Don't call

  15   us, we will call you.  They never called him.  They never

  16   needed him.  He was never part of any plan.

  17            In 1995 when he went back to Dar-es-Salaam.  He lived

  18   there with his brother and he continued to live with his

  19   brother, his brother's family and he worked there with him.

  20   '96, his brother lost the shop, but he still continued to live

  21   with his brother.  '97, he still lived with his brother and

  22   the family but when his brother had to move to London for

  23   whatever reason, for business reasons, so he began to live

  24   with other members of his family.

  25            For '95, '96 and '97 he just went about his life.

   1   There was no contact with anyone, no bombs, no discussions, no

   2   Bin Laden, no al Qaeda.  There was nothing, no training,

   3   nobody contacted him, nothing.  He was working.  He was

   4   studying.  He was living with his family.  And that's what he

   5   did.

   6            In 19'97 he took a trip to Mombasa, a city in Kenya,

   7   not Nairobi.  Mombasa is a different city.  He went there.  He

   8   traveled.  He met some people.  He discussed Islam with other

   9   people, and he prayed at different locations.  He had no

  10   discussions no nothing, no meetings with Bin Laden, nothing to

  11   do with al Qaeda, no bombing.  That's '97.
