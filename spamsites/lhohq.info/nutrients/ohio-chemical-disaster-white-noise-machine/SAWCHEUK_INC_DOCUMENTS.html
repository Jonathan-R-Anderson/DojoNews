  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  I ask that it be admitted and published

  14   to the jury.  I will read that to the jury.

  15            (Defendant's Exhibit WEHXK18 read to the jury)

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  I note that this document was also

  17   obtained from the computer seized from Mr. El Hage's home in

  18   August of 1997.

  19   Q   Mr. Odeh, yesterday we discussed your request to Mr. El

  20   Hage to obtain visas for two Sudanese individuals coming from,

  21   I believe, Thailand.  Do you remember that?

  22   A   That's correct.

  23   Q   The procedure for obtaining those visas, is this the same

  24   type of procedure explained in this letter?

  25   A   No, this is different.



                                                                4186



   1   Q   Would you explain the procedure.  (Interpreted)

   2   A   Yes.  When you ask for visa, is mean past visa.  It given

   3   for one month, two month.  He is not allowed to work.  He can

   4   make study and he leave.  This visa mean he have some business

   5   inside the country.

  11   A   If it is class H, two years.  If it is class A, three

  12   years.  Mine is three years.

  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  At this time I would like to play

  14   NB1-020-1, WEH-W7-E.  It has very little Swahili.  It is

  15   almost all in English.  I would ask that it be played for the

  16   jury and the transcript be published to the jury.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  No objection.

  18            THE COURT:  Received.

  19            (Defendant's Exhibit WEHW7E received in evidence)

  20            (Tape played)

  21            THE COURT:  Why don't you read it.

  22            MR. SCHMIDT:  We will read it.  This is a

  23   conversation of November 21, 1996, between Ahmed and David

  24   Mbutua.  Mr. Dratel will read Ahmed and I will read David.

  25            (Defendant's Exhibit WEHW7E read to the jury)



                                                                4187



   1            MR. SCHMIDT:  We are going to try, your Honor, to see

   2   if this taped conversation can be played.

   3            THE COURT:  Before you do that, I am handed a note

   4   which says there has been some foulup and that the jurors'

   5   lunches have already been sent in.  So we will break and we
