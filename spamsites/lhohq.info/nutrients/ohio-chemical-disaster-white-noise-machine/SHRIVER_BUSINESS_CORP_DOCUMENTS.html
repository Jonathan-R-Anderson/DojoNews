   1   A.  Or angry, yes, sir.

   2   Q.  You did use the word "agitated" from time to time?

   3   A.  I could have.  I'm not sure.

   4   Q.  Let me --

   5            MR. COHN:  May I approach, your Honor?

   6            THE COURT:  Yes.

   7   Q.  Let me show you a document of the government, a report of

   8   yours of 8/13/98; ask you to look at the last paragraph.

   9   A.  Yes, sir.

  10   Q.  Did you use the word "agitated"?

  11   A.  The word "agitated" is used there, yes, sir.

  12   Q.  And you wrote it?

  13   A.  This particular report I did not write.  I had co-authored

  14   it, meaning I just, after the person who was responsible for

  15   writing it did write it, I agreed in context what it said.

  16   Q.  You read it?

  17   A.  I did read it.

  18   Q.  And after reading it, you signed it as authorizing it as a

  19   co-author?

  20   A.  That's right.

  21   Q.  Is it fair to say, sir, that over the period of the nine

  22   days that he was interrogated and left in isolation various

  23   times --

  24            MR. BUTLER:  Objection.

  25            THE COURT:  Sustained.



                                                                2108



   1            MR. COHN:  May I finish the question?

   2            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   3   Q.  Over the period of the nine days of interrogations and

   4   periods when you did not see him, that he became progressively

   5   more and more agitated for more of the time?

   6   A.  I wouldn't say that.

   7   Q.  You would not?

   8   A.  No, sir.

   9            MR. COHN:  Bear with me one minute, your Honor.

  10            (Pause)

  11            MR. COHN:  I have nothing further.

  12            THE COURT:  Government redirect.

  13            MR. BUTLER:  Briefly, your Honor.

  14   REDIRECT EXAMINATION

  15   BY MR. BUTLER:

  16   Q.  Agent Gaudin, Mr. Cohn asked you some questions about, on

  17   cross-examination about the interviews that took place from

  18   August 12th to August 21st.  Remember those questions?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  And during those interviews, did you take breaks during

  21   those interviews?

  22   A.  Yes, we did.

  23   Q.  And was Mr. al-'Owhali permitted to pray during those

  24   interviews?

  25   A.  Whenever he asked to pray, he was granted the opportunity



                                                                2109



   1   to pray, yes, sir.

   2   Q.  And was Mr. al-'Owhali given food during the course of

   3   those interviews?

   4   A.  Whenever he asked for it, he was.

   5   Q.  And did you voluntarily give him food, even if he didn't

   6   ask for it?

   7   A.  Yes.  There were times that I became hungry during this

   8   process and I would take food out for myself, whether it be a

   9   candy bar or whatever I had with me, and I didn't feel right

  10   eating it in front of anyone in the room.  I would ask them if

  11   they wanted some and I asked him if he wanted some.  Sometimes

  12   he took it, sometimes he didn't.

  13   Q.  During these interviews from August 12th on to August
