   1   30 questions.  He say study these questions clear and try to

   2   memorize, and you have the chance to see Saddiq al Mahdi, try

   3   to ask him those questions, and we need you to be careful with

   4   the answer.  Whatever answer he say, when the meeting finish

   5   and you went far from his house, try quick put all answer he

   6   say, and we going to sit down and we need the answers.

   7   Q   So what happened when you had the meeting with Saddiq al

   8   Mahdi?

   9   A   We went to his house with somebody, his name was Mutwakal.

  10   This is the first time I saw him, first time I sit down with

  11   him, and he say I hear you working for Afghanistan and he kick

  12   the Russia out and that's great job, and he say he went to the

  13   Iran before and he liked if the Muslims come together, Sunni

  14   and Shia.

  15            After that we asking him what you think about the

  16   what going on in Sudan now, and he said Islamic National

  17   Front, sometimes they make agreement with our party but they

  18   break the agreement, sometimes they work together, sometimes

  19   we split, and he said I did with them 30 years, and he say

  20   sometimes our group make relationship with them but later on

  21   they break their promise.  And he say it's better for the

  22   Sudan if all the group come to together and make one

  23   government, and he say since 1956 when the Sudan government

  24   run the country, there is no government, bring all Sudanese

  25   people together.



                                                                378
