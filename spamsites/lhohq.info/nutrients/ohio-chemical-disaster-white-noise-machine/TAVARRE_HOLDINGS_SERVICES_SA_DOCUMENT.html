  10            MR. COHN:  But I think that the dwelling on the plea

  11   to killing Americans requires your reiteration of your charge

  12   that the plea of a coconspirator is not usable against the

  13   other defendants.  I think that it's called for again at this

  14   time.

  15            THE COURT:  Again?

  16            MR. COHN:  I do.

  17            THE COURT:  All right.  We'll take a three-minute

  18   recess.

  19            (Recess)

  20            THE COURT:  The jury may be brought in.

  21            Ladies and gentlemen, let me just take a moment to

  22   remind you of something I have already told you and will tell

  23   you again in my charge with respect to the fact that a witness

  24   such as the witness now on the stand has pled guilty to

  25   charges arising out of circumstances related to the facts of



                                                                4819



   1   this case.

   2            You are to draw no conclusions or inference of any

   3   kind about the guilt of the defendants on trial here from the

   4   fact that a witness pled guilty to similar charges.  The

   5   decision of the witness to plead guilty was based on a

   6   personal decision of his concerning his own guilt in light of

   7   benefits afforded by the government to someone who was

   8   cooperating, and so this witness's decision to plead guilty

   9   may not be used by you in any way as evidence against or

  10   unfavorable to the four defendants on trial here.

  11            Mr. Schmidt, you may resume.

  12            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, at this point, I wish to

  13   offer the following exhibits into evidence:  WEHX-M-7X-21, the

  14   original and the translation, which is the same number with a

  15   T at the end.
