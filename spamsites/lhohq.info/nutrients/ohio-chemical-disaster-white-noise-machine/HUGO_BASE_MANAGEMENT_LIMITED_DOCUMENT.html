  10     disproving the existence of anything which the

  11     government must prove beyond a reasonable

  12     doubt.  The burden is wholly upon the

  13     government; the law does not at all require

  14     Mr. Mohamed to produce evidence that a

  15     particular aggravating factor does not exist or

  16     that death is not an appropriate sentence.

  17               As such, Mr. Mohamed is not required

  18     to assert or establish any mitigating factors.

  19     However, if one or more mitigating factors are

  20     asserted, it is Mr. Mohamed's burden to

  21     establish any mitigating factors by a

  22     preponderance of the evidence.  To prove

  23     something by a preponderance of the evidence is

  24     a lesser standard of proof than proof beyond a

  25     reasonable doubt.  To prove something by a

                                                                8709

                             CHARGE

   2     preponderance of the evidence is to prove that

   3     it is more likely true than not true.  It is

   4     determined by considering all of the evidence

   5     and deciding what of the evidence is more

   6     believable.  If, however, the evidence is

   7     equally balanced, you cannot find that the

   8     mitigating factor has been proved.

   9               The preponderance of the evidence is

  10     not determined by the greater number of

  11     witnesses or exhibits presented by the

  12     government or the defendant.  Rather, it is the

  13     quality and persuasiveness of the information

  14     which controls.

  15               In making all the determinations you

  16     are required to make in this phase of the

  17     trial, you may consider any information

  18     presented during this penalty phase and the

  19     guilt phase, but excluding any evidence which

  20     was introduced solely against another

  21     defendant.  Also, recall that for our purposes

  22     here the terms "evidence" and "information"

  23     have the same meaning.

  24               In deciding what the facts are, you

  25     may have to decide which testimony you believe

                                                                8710

   2     and what testimony you do not believe.  You may

   3     believe all of what a witness said, or only

   4     part of it, or none of it.  In deciding what

   5     testimony of any witness to believe, consider

   6     the witness's intelligence, the opportunity the

   7     witness had to see or hear the things testified

   8     about, the witness's memory, any motives that

   9     witness may have for testifying in a certain

  10     way, the manner of the witness while

  11     testifying, whether that witness said something

  12     different at an earlier time, the general

  13     reasonableness of the testimony, and the extent

  14     to which the testimony is consistent with other

  15     evidence that you believe.

  16               Additionally, because the law does

  17     not permit any witness to state whether he or

  18     she favors or opposes the death penalty in this

  19     case, you should draw no inference either way

  20     from the fact that no witnesses have testified

  21     as to their views on this subject.

  22               Mr. Mohamed did not testify in this

  23     case.  He has a right not to do so and there is

  24     no burden upon Mr. Mohamed to prove that he

  25     should not be sentenced to death.  Instead, the


                        REPORTERS CENTRAL

   1   173lbinf
                             CHARGE

   2     burden is entirely on the prosecution to prove,

   3     beyond a reasonable doubt, that a sentence of

   4     death is in fact justified.  Accordingly, that

   5     Mr. Mohamed did not testify must not be

   6     considered by you in any way, or even

   7     discussed, in arriving at any aspect of your

   8     sentencing decision, including the existence or

   9     nonexistence of an alleged aggravating or

  10     mitigating factor.

  11               You must deliberate and determine the

  12     appropriate sentence for each of the capital

  13     counts separately.  Although I will be

  14     discussing the capital counts as a group, your

  15     findings regarding gateway factors, aggravating

  16     factors, and all other issues pertaining to

  17     these counts must treat each of these counts

  18     separately.  It is possible that, even though

  19     all of the counts are connected with the

  20     bombing of the Dar es Salaam embassy, you may

  21     find differences which would justify different

  22     sentences on different counts.

  23               The instructions I am about to give

  24     you, as well as the Special Verdict Form you

  25     will be completing, will first address your
