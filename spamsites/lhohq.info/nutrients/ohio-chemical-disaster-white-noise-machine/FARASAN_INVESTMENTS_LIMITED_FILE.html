<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">   4   witness, put the numbers on the record and then the set of

   5   photographs to which Mr. Baugh may reference in his opening

   6   which is a set of photographs or names of the deceased

   7   victims.  We can offer them now and they can start with the

   8   defense case.

   9            THE COURT:  You want to offer them in the absence of

  10   the jury?

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  We can offer them at the very

  12   beginning then and then we'll be completed.

  13            THE COURT:  All right.  The jury is here.  Why don't

  14   we begin.

   1            (In open court)

   2            THE COURT:  I don't remember whether I told you that

   3   sometime midday you should get another revision of the

   4   proposed charge.  The principal changes relate to the

   5   references to the statutes, and the government has indicated

   6   that it is not seeking incorporation by reference of Section

   7   (i) of --

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  844.

   9            THE COURT:  -- of 844.  So we'll leave that.  You

  10   should have that midday.

  11            We're in agreement that we're not sitting Friday even

  12   if the jury is deliberating?

  13            MR. COHN:  I'm sorry.  They are not sitting even if

  14   we're deliberating?

  15            THE COURT:  I thought that was what the request was.

  16            MR. COHN:  I thought that, too.  Here's the question.

  17   I have been confused on that issue today.

  18            THE COURT:  Excuse me?

  19            MR. COHN:  And remain confused.  I said I've been

  20   confused on that issue today and remain confused.  I did raise

  21   it because I thought the Court had said we weren't.  It is not

  22   a request of mine, at any rate.

  23            THE COURT:  Let's discuss it at the midmorning break.

  24            On June 11th we're going to adjourn at 3:00, and this

  25   Wednesday we're going to adjourn at 3:00.  The request for



                                                                7001



   1   this early adjournment indicates how conscientious the jury

   2   is.  This one is "to attend a closing of a sale of my deceased

   3   mother's apartment."  These are not things that the jurors can

   4   easily postpone.

   5            What is the view?  It seems the jury will be

   6   deliberating.  Do you want to sit on Friday or not sit on

   7   Friday?

   8            MR. BAUGH:  Not really.

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  We would prefer the jury just

  10   proceed and deliberate.  It's not extraordinary to sit during

  11   the week and rather than shut down for Friday, Saturday,

  12   Sunday and resume again on Monday.

  13            THE COURT:  You wish to sit on Friday?

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.  I think it's not unusual.

  15   Many jurors sit over weekends to sit during weekdays.

  16            THE COURT:  I'm going to tell them they will sit on

  17   Friday and we will adjourn at 3:00 on Wednesday and on Monday.

  18            (Jury present)

  19            THE COURT:  Good morning.

  20            THE JURY:  Good morning.

  21            THE COURT:  Just some logistical matters.  This

  22   Wednesday we will adjourn at 3:00 to accommodate the request

  23   of a juror.  Based on what the attorneys tell me, the

  24   probability is that this case will be fully submitted before

  25   you for deliberations by the end of this week, and we will sit



                                                                7002



   1   this Friday.  We will sit this Friday.

   2            You can't sit this Friday?

   3            A JUROR:  No, I cannot.

   4            THE COURT:  We will not sit this Friday.

   5            And next Monday, the 11th, we will adjourn at 3:00

   6   also.

   7            All right.  Mr. Fitzgerald.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.  The government is just

   9   offering for the record six exhibits, which are Government

  10   Exhibits 2002, which is a set of pages through page 214, and

  11   the following photographs:  Government Exhibits 2255, 2256,
