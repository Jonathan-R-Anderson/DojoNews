  17   Pakistan?

  18   A   That is my understanding, yes.

  19   Q   Dr. Lloyd, please look at what has been marked in evidence

  20   Defense Exhibit Odeh DD.  Have you seen that photo before?

  21   A   I have seen the photo before, I believe.  I'm not quite

  22   certain whether this particular one has been seen by me,

  23   but --

  24   Q   You got to speak into the microphone.

  25   A   I beg your pardon.



                                                                4007



   1            Yes, I have seen a photograph, or one similar to

   2   this, before.

   3   Q   Did you see the actual bag as well?

   4   A   Yes, I have seen the bag.

   5   Q   Dr. Lloyd, looking on your screen, I hope -- thank you --

   6   is Odeh Exhibit DD.  Is that the bag that you looked at with

   7   the clothing in it?

   8   A   Yes, it appears to be.

   9   Q   Is it your understanding that that's how these items were

  10   contained in the bag before they were taken out and packaged

  11   or some of them packaged individually?

  12   A   It is my understanding, yes.

  13   Q   Taking you back to the analysis that Kelly Mount

  14   performed, is there any indication from any of the documents

  15   that you have reviewed or from her testimony that she was able

  16   to determine the amount of explosives which she found on these

  17   various items?

  18   A   I've seen no evidence that the amount of explosives on

  19   these items was determined.

  20   Q   As a forensic scientist, is it important to you when you

  21   make an analysis of items and you come up with a positive

  22   finding to make a determination as to the amount of the

  23   explosives on a particular item?

  24   A   Yes, it is very helpful to do that.

  25   Q   Could you explain to the jury, based on your knowledge and



                                                                4008



   1   experience and background, why that's important and helpful?

   2   A   First of all, very simply, the more explosive there is,

   3   the more significant the evidence is likely to be.  If there's

   4   a large amount of explosive on a person's clothing, that is

   5   clearly of greater significance or likely to be of greater

   6   significance than if a very tiny trace of explosive is

   7   present.

   8            If a person has been in recent contact with

   9   explosives, with intact explosive or perhaps has been trying

  10   to make a bomb or something of that sort, then one would

  11   expect to see a large amount of explosive on his clothing.

  12   One would not expect to see merely a trace of explosive.  It

  13   could be a residue from a contact with explosive a long time

  14   ago, or it could be a trace picked up because he's been in

  15   contact with a contaminated surface, a contaminated person.

  16   This sort of information can be indicated to a person if he

  17   knows how much explosive was there.  In this case, it seems we

  18   do not.

  19   Q   Dr. Lloyd, given the techniques which the FBI used, do you

  20   have an explanation or can you determine why the amounts were

  21   not identified in this case?

  22   A   It seems to me that the reasons given by the FBI are that

  23   they do not consider this to be an important matter.  There's

  24   no fundamental reason why the quantities couldn't have been

  25   determined, in my view.



                                                                4009



   1   Q   Could the tests that the FBI lab performed, could they

   2   have been calibrated to give us some information as to the

   3   amount of explosives as well as whether or not explosives were

   4   found to exist?

   5   A   Yes, in my view, without too much difficulty they could

   6   have been calibrated to determine the amount of explosive that

   7   had been recovered or detected on the items that we're

   8   concerned with.

   9   Q   Are you familiar with the sensitivity of the tests which
