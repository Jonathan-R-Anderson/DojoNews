<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  20   Q.  Tell us what that conversation was.

  21   A.  Officer Pepe said that he suggested to Mr. Salim, since he

  22   wanted to use the computer, that he would put him directly in

  23   the computer room, and I think he asked Mr. McAllister and me

  24   would we like to go into the room adjacent to it.  That is,

  25   the computer room is the uppermost room labeled attorney




                                                                8289


   1   visit, and there is a screen between that and the adjacent

   2   room which says INM, inmate visit, I guess.  Officer Pepe

   3   asked if we would like to go into that room -- it's a rather

   4   small room -- so that we could talk to Mr. Salim while he was

   5   using the computer, and we said yes.

   6   Q.  Did you see Mr. Salim brought out subsequent to that

   7   conversation, in the sense of being brought into the area?

   8   A.  Yes, but first Officer Pepe placed Mr. McAllister into the

   9   inmate, I will call it inmate visit room, and locked the door.

  10   Q.  Is that normal procedure?

  11   A.  It's the first time, actually, that I had been in that

  12   room.

  13   Q.  Prior to that day, where had you conducted interviews with

  14   Mr. Salim, again looking at the diagram?

  15   A.  Typically in the room called recreation, the one on the

  16   lower right, the most northerly part of the diagram.  I see

  17   two recreation rooms.  It's the northernmost one.

  18   Q.  Was that set up with a folding table and some chairs so

  19   that you could have conversation, attorney-client visits?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  If you recall the visits there, during those

  22   attorney-client visits, would the inmate -- not the inmate,

  23   but would Mr. Salim be shackled or handcuffed in any way while

  24   these visits were going on in the recreation room?

  25   A.  Once in the room, typically not.




                                                                8290


   1   Q.  Returning now to November 1, you and Mr. McAllister were

   2   locked into the small inmate visit room.  At some point did

   3   you then see Mr. Salim being brought to the area?

   4   A.  Yes, shortly after.

   5   Q.  Was he cuffed?

   6   A.  He was.

   7   Q.  Front or back?

   8   A.  Back.

   9   Q.  Who was escorting him?

  10   A.  Officer Pepe.

  11   Q.  What occurred next?  What did you see Officer Pepe do with

  12   Mr. Salim next?

  13   A.  He opened the door to the attorney visiting room, that is,

  14   the room denominated here the attorney visiting room, the

  15   computer room.  Mr. Salim went into the room.  Officer Pepe

  16   locked the door behind him.  There is a slot in the middle of

  17   that door which Officer Pepe opened.  Mr. Salim, without being

  18   instructed, turned with his back towards the door, he being on

  19   the inside, put his wrists through that slot.  Officer Pepe

  20   removed the handcuffs and then slid through the door a file

  21   that apparently he had carried for Mr. Salim when he brought

  22   him to the room.

  23   Q.  Do you remember how Mr. Salim was dressed, what he was

  24   wearing at that point?

  25   A.  Yes.




                                                                8291


   1   Q.  What was he wearing?

   2   A.  He was wearing an orange jump suit.

   3   Q.  What occurred once Mr. Salim was in the computer room,

   4   attorney visit room, and things began to happen?  What

   5   happened next?  What did he do?  What do you?

   6   A.  There came a point that he called for Mr. Pepe, Officer

   7   Pepe, who arrived.

   8   Q.  Did you see Mr. Salim attempting to run software or CDs or

   9   use the computer to bring up some kind of data?

  10   A.  I think, I think the answer to that question might intrude

  11   on issues of privilege and confidentiality which I should not

  12   respond to.

  13   Q.  Were there communications presented to the MCC in the

  14   past, Metropolitan Correctional Center in the past on

  15   Mr. Salim's behalf, complaining about the computer setup?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  After Mr. Salim called for Officer Pepe, what occurred

  18   next?

  19   A.  Officer Pepe asked him if he was done, and he indicated he

  20   wasn't but that he wanted some additional material from the

  21   cell.

  22   Q.  What happened after that?

  23   A.  Officer Pepe opened the door --

  24   Q.  Did you see Officer Pepe cuff Mr. Salim before he opened

  25   the door?




                                                                8292


   1   A.  I don't believe so.

   2   Q.  Did you see him cuff him after he opened the door?

   3   A.  I don't believe so.

   4   Q.  Did you see Mr. Salim do anything with the jump suit that

   5   he was wearing?

   6   A.  He took it off, yes, took it off.

   7   Q.  What was he wearing underneath it?

   8   A.  He was wearing, my best recollection is what appeared to

   9   be a light material khaki shirt -- no, khaki shorts, and a

  10   white T-shirt, or an off-white T-shirt.

  11   Q.  After Mr. Salim was let out of the cell, did you see him
