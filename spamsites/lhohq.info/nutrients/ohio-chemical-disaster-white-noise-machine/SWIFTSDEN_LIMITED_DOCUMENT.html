   1   Q.  Do you remember Mr. Karas asking you a question regarding

   2   the washing of clothes and the effect that would have on the

   3   TNT residue?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  You said that after a few washings with normal soap

   6   emulsifiers would in fact dissipate the TNT so that you

   7   wouldn't be able to find the residue; is that correct?

   8   A.  That is in correct.

   9   Q.  If the clothes in fact were not washed, if they were

  10   placed in a bag and held in the bag for several weeks without

  11   being washed at all, you would in fact then find TNT residue;

  12   is that correct?

  13   A.  If those items of clothing had been exposed to fairly

  14   significant quantities of explosives, yes, that TNT would

  15   definitely remain on those clothings after several weeks.

  16   Q.  Do you have any way of measuring the area on a particular

  17   piece of clothing on which TNT residue was found?  Would it be

  18   from a particular grid, centimeters by centimeters or inches

  19   by inches, or would you just say TNT residue was found?

  20   A.  Generally speaking we vacuum the clothing items.  In

  21   particular we try to vacuum areas which are going to be in

  22   contact with the person's hands or touching area.  So we would

  23   be doing pockets where generally hands would be going.  Again,

  24   those would be the most likely areas where a transfer of

  25   explosive residue would be found.

                                Kelly - cross

   1   Q.  But for clothes that were in a bag, some uncontaminated

   2   with respect to TNT and TNT-contaminated clothes that were in

   3   a bag, you would have no way of knowing which part was

   4   transferred to which part, would you?

   5            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, objection to form.

   6            THE COURT:  Overruled.  Do you understand the

   7   question?

   8            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I do.

   9            THE COURT:  You may answer.

  10   A.  Items of clothing that are commingled in a bag, the action

  11   of just putting them in and the surfaces of the clothing

  12   rubbing could transfer TNT from pieces with clothes to a piece

  13   of clothing without exposure, yes.
