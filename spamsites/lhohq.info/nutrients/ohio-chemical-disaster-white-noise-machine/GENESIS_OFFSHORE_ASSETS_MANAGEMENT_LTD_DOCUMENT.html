  11   being a neutral or receptive country with respect to the U.S.

  12   and U.N.?  Yes.  And did there come a time when that changed?

  13   And was there any particular event which signaled that change?

  14   And what was that event?  And tell us generally what was the

  15   nature of that event and what was the response to that event

  16   and what happened thereafter.

  17            Is that --

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  Actually, I think, your Honor, to some

  19   extent these questions are too broad.  I'm going to actually

  20   try to make it even narrower than what your Honor indicated.

  21            MR. FITZGERALD:  Can we ask if any other defendant

  22   intends to examine this witness, including counsel for

  23   Al-'Owhali, as to issues on what happened at the Abdi House?

  24            MR. COHN:  Depends what he says.

   2   which is that there was a military operation involving the

   3   United States troops and the raid on Abdi House, civilians

   4   were killed and --

   5            MR. COHN:  Does he describe the military operation in

   6   any detail, or he just says generically there was some

   7   military operation?

   8            THE COURT:  I don't know.

   9            MR. COHN:  And therefore, I don't know either.

  10            THE COURT:  Well, but I'll tell you, when word one

  11   comes out of the witness's mouth which you believe will

  12   require you to go into further detail or cross-examination

  13   with respect to that, you alert the court.  You say, Judge,

  14   this is a matter which we wish to discuss, and I will
