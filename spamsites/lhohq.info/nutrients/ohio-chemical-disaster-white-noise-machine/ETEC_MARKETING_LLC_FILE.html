  22            Nassor Zahran Maulid, date of birth 24th April 1997.

  23   My name is Zahran Nassor Maulid and I am a native of Zanzibar

  24   in Tanzania.  I came here in South Africa due to problems and

  25   those problems are the ones that prompted me to flee my



                                                                2937



   1   country.  My job was to arrange venues for political meetings

   2   that were held by the CUF opposition party.  Those activities

   3   did not please the leaders of the ruling party, the CCM.  So

   4   they decided to use the force in their hands to harass us

   5   members of that opposition party.  Then I decided to run away

   6   and look for means to come here in South Africa.  I left Dar

   7   es Salaam on the 9th August 1998 and entered Mozambique the

   8   very same day.  From there I proceeded and came to South

   9   Africa, where I arrived on the 16th August 1998.  That is my

  10   statement in short.

  11            And then if we could display 1003-1.

  12            Your Honor, next the government would propose to read

  13   from a stipulation marked for identification as Exhibit 57:
