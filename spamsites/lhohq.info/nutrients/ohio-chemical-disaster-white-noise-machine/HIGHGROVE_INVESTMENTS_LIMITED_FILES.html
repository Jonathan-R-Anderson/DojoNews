   2            If possible we also would try to go to various

   3   bombing crime scenes to have hands-on training at the scene in

   4   terms of learning about how the bombs function, assisting in

   5   the processing of the crime scene, collecting evidence from

   6   the crime scene, and even conducting field examinations of the

   7   evidence that was found at these crime scenes.

   8   Q   Can you tell us about your formal education.

   9   A   My formal education consists of some background in

  10   forensic science and also in public administration.  Most

  11   recently, I graduated from the George Washington University

  12   with a master's in forensic science, and previously I had

  13   attended Indiana University, where I had earned a bachelor's

  14   degree in forensic studies and master's degree in public

  15   administration.

  16   Q   Have you attended seminars and conferences in the field of

  17   forensics?

  18   A   Yes, I have.

  19   Q   You mentioned that you had been to crime scenes.  Can you

  20   tell us approximately how many bombing crime scenes you have

  21   participated in in investigating?

  22   A   If I were to include our training seminars as well as

  23   actual bombing crime scenes involving criminal activity, I

  24   would venture probably in the neighborhood of 150 over the

  25   course of my career.



                                                                2541



   1   Q   Among those 150 crime scenes, did some of them involve

   2   suspected vehicle bombs?

   3   A   Yes, a number of them did.

   4   Q   Can you give us some examples?

   5   A   Most recently, in 1993 I was involved in the investigation

   6   of the World Trade Center here in New York, and again in 1995

   7   I was assigned to a similar crime scene in Riyadh, Saudi

   8   Arabia.  That involved the bombing of the office of personnel

   9   management of the Saudi Arabian National Guard.  Also in 1995

  10   I had worked at the Oklahoma City bombing crime scene in the

  11   spring of '95.  In 1996 I had been involved in the

  12   investigation of the TWA 800.
