  25            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, as one of the lawyers who is




                                                                6533


   1   closest to the courtroom, would you like me to be here early?

   2   I'll take the responsibility for calling my co-counsel.

   3            THE COURT:  Fine.  Be here at 9:30.  That will be

   4   fine.

   5            MR. BAUGH:  Do you want me here before that?

   6            THE COURT:  In the past the jurors have been getting

   7   here about ten minutes after 9.

   8            MR. RUHNKE:  I just noted in the past when we had a

   9   juror who was sick there was apparently a mechanism for

  10   contacting the Marshals to tell them they were not going to be

  11   able to come.

  12            THE COURT:  To contact the other jurors?

  13            MR. RUHNKE:  I don't know if there is such a

  14   mechanism.

  15            THE COURT:  I'll leave that to the Marshals.  The

  16   other thing that I've been thinking about is whether we should

  17   contact the alternates and give them some clue that their

  18   lives must be very much in limbo, and I suppose the clue --

  19   let's think about that at the close of business tomorrow.  All

  20   right.  Thank you all.

  21            (Adjourned to 9:30 a.m., Thursday, May 24, 2000)
