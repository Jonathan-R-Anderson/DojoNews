   1   Wednesday, but I think maybe we can resolve that.

   2            I would like to see a copy of the protective order in

   3   this case.  Does someone have that?

   4            Let me know when counsel for K.K. Mohammed arrives.

   5            (All counsel present)

   6            THE COURT:  Please note that at 10:00 a.m. the jury

   7   arrived and the exhibits requested were sent in to them.

   1            THE COURT:  Is the matter of the motion to quash the

   2   subpoena for Madeleine Albright fully submitted and ready for

   3   disposition?

   4            MR. BAUGH:  It is, your Honor.

   5            THE COURT:  The declaration by Mr. Mason, the

   6   attorney adviser for the Department of State, states that the

   7   subpoena served upon Madeleine Albright did not have attached

   8   to it the statement which was attached to the subpoena

   9   submitted to the court.  Was that intentional or inadvertent?

  10            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, it must have been

  11   inadvertent, because when we gave you the subpoena it had it

  12   attached and you signed it and it was given to us without the

  13   attached, and we took it to the Marshal Service.  The one that

  14   Mr. Kenneally handed me in the hallway had come back and you

  15   didn't have it on there, so we ran it across the street.  I

  16   don't know why you kept it.  I was told you kept it.

  17            THE COURT:  I kept it?  I don't keep subpoenas.  I

  18   signed the subpoena and I gave it to someone to give to you.

  19            MR. BAUGH:  I sent back that morning a statement with

  20   the attachment on it and it was brought out to me, and the

  21   subpoena was brought out, and I was told that the CFR was,

  22   something to the effect that it was kept back there.  But I

  23   prepared it.

  24            THE COURT:  So it was inadvertent.

  25            MR. BAUGH:  It was inadvertent, yes.



                                                                6267



   1            THE COURT:  Because Mr. Mason raises the point that

   2   there has not been compliance with the CFR, and he also states

   3   that former Secretary Albright's staff has informed me that

   4   she will be traveling extensively within and outside the

   5   United States for the next two months for business.

   6            Does the government have any objection to our dealing

   7   with this matter on the assumption that the attachments to the

   8   subpoena as furnished to the court and to the U.S. Attorney's

   9   Office were part of the service upon the ex-secretary?

  10            MR. GARCIA:  Your Honor, the government would suggest

  11   that we go forward, argue the merits of the subpoena, and if

  12   necessary and Miss Albright is required, he can reserve the

  13   right to serve a subpoena with the attachment at a later date.

  14            THE COURT:  Mr. Baugh, is there anything you wish to

  15   add to your previous submissions?

  16            MR. BAUGH:  Yes, your Honor, very briefly.  First, I

  17   apologize for not giving anything back in writing.  The

  18   subpoena was served relatively late.  I understand that the
