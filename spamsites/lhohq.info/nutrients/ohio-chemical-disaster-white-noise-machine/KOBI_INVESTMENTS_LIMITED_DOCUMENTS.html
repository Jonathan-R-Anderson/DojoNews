<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">   3            As I stated in the letter, however, given the

   4   powerful nature of the victim impact evidence in this case

   5   that the jury has heard, had we had a joint penalty trial, we


   6   would have moved for a severance at that point on the theory

   7   that we don't think it is possible for a jury to

   8   compartmentalize that evidence as to Mr. al-'Owhali and give

   9   it no consideration as to Mr. Khalfan Mohamed.

  10            THE COURT:  I have not had any occasion to regret the

  11   decision to sever the trial, because I do think that the

  12   defendants are quite different and that positions, I think,

  13   that are taken on behalf of Mr. al-'Owhali may or may not be

  14   those invoked on behalf of K.K. Mohamed.

  15            Is that a note from the jury?

  16            THE COURT:  A note from the jury says.  "Because the

  17   book 'Teach Yourself Islam' makes references to the Koran, the

  18   jury requests a copy of the Koran in English, if possible.

  19   Thank you."

  20            Well, it is possible, but neither party has

  21   introduced the Koran, and the Koran in English is not a very

  22   simple document to read and it requires a great deal of

  23   exposition.

  24            What does counsel view as to the response?

  25            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, the government's view



                                                                7276



   1   would be that the Koran should not be sent into the jury, both

   2   it was not received as information at this proceeding and the

   3   danger of confusing the jury and leading them astray is great.

   4            The purpose of the book "Teaching Islam" or

   5   "Understanding Islam" was to make those concepts in the Koran

   6   that are relevant plain to the jury, and in fact, they

   7   received more than was technically admitted at this phase and

   8   I think that is the most that should happen.  And to the

   9   extent there are issues relevant to what they need to know,

  10   they are set forth in that book.

  11            MR. BAUGH:  I would point out, your Honor, if it's

  12   viewed as reference material, such as if the jury would ask

  13   for a dictionary or something like that, something to help

  14   them understand something else, then I assume -- it's never

  15   come up directly -- but it would be sent back.

  16            THE COURT:  I'm not so sure that's a correct

  17   assumption.

  18            MR. BAUGH:  No no.

  19            THE COURT:  In a trial I'm not sure that is a correct

  20   assumption, and obviously we're not at a trial, we're at a

  21   hearing for information.  But the difference is that a

  22   dictionary is written, an English dictionary is written for an

  23   English-speaking reader and is directed to that reader.  It

  24   itself is explanatory.

  25            The Koran is a far more complex and difficult



                                                                7277



   1   document, and there are many versions and many scholars.  And

   2   the version of the Koran that I have been reading has three

   3   lines of text and footnotes for the balance of the page on

   4   virtually every page.


   5            If there is no objection, I'm going to tell them that

   6   it is not available to them.

   7            MR. BAUGH:  No objection from the defense.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  None here.

   9            THE COURT:  And I think without extensive exposition,

  10   simply say --

  11            MR. COHN:  If I may suggest, your Honor, that you say

  12   that, so that we don't appear to be consciously depriving them

  13   of an accurate state of the law, that we may not send back

  14   anything that is not in evidence.

  15            THE COURT:  Except that we sent the full text of the

  16   book.

  17            MR. COHN:  Pardon?

  18            THE COURT:  Except that we sent the full text of the

  19   book.

  20            We are not able to.  How about "we are not able to

  21   grant you..."

  22            MR. COHN:  Fine, your Honor.

  23            And while we're doing that, there was a typographical

  24   error in the text of the charge which I caught, and so that

  25   the oral version was accurate.  But since they don't have the



                                                                7278



   1   oral version, it's on page 22, the last line, the first full

   2   paragraph reads, "that life in prison without the possibility

   3   of release is the a appropriate," and it should read "is the

   4   more appropriate."

   5            MR. COHN:  I actually saw notes to that to prevent

   6   problems that have occurred in the past.  I agree that that is

   7   a proper change that should be made.

   8            THE COURT:  Yes.  We'll tell them that.

   9            MR. COHN:  Judge, just for the record while you read
