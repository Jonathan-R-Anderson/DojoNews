   4   leaving out letters.  I would like to explain ex parte, in

   5   camera, why not only is this situation different than

   6   cocounsel's situation, but why we resorted to the subpoena to

   7   CNN for this specific piece of evidence, at this specific

   8   time.

   9            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, on behalf of Al-'Owhali, we

  10   would like to join in counsel's request for that specific item

  11   and we would rely upon their subpoena, that specific item,

  12   which is different.

  13            THE COURT:  I think it would be very difficult to do

  14   this on an ex parte basis, because you are seeking raw and

  15   uncut footage of Cable News Network and that is an issue which

  16   the Second Circuit has clearly addressed, and I am not going

  17   to grant such a subpoena without giving CNN an opportunity to

  18   oppose it.

  19            MR. SCHMIDT:  I am perfectly willing to address the

  20   situation with CNN.  I am not willing to address the situation

  21   with the government unless your Honor signs it, and I can even

  22   deal with the motion to quash right now.

  23            THE COURT:  Is CNN still here?

  24            MR. SCHULZ:  Yes, your Honor.

  25            THE COURT:  Let's take up the bifurcation issue,



                                                                4095



   1   because then I think maybe we can let some people go home.  I

   2   was told earlier in the day that the government's position

   3   with respect to bifurcation -- by bifurcation, talking about

   4   separate penalty trials with respect to Al-'Owhali and K.K.

   5   Mohamed.  The government has filed a memorandum opposing

   6   bifurcation on the present state of the record.  What is the

   7   government's position?

   8            MR. GARCIA:  Judge, that is correct, we filed a

   9   motion opposing bifurcation on the present record.  The

  10   government read Mr. Ruhnke's response to that motion wherein

  11   he indicates that there will not be significant overlap

  12   between the two phases, which was the government's concern

  13   expressed in the response, and has offered to make a proffer

  14   to the court to that effect outside the presence of the

  15   government, which is acceptable to the government in

  16   addressing that issue.  If that is acceptable and the

  17   government accepts Mr. Ruhnke's representation that there will

  18   be no significant overlap, that addresses the government's

  19   concern that there will be two, essentially, overlapping,

  20   significantly overlapping proceedings, and the cases cited in

  21   that response.  In that case the government would be prepared

  22   to withdraw its opposition.

  23            THE COURT:  I have some problems, and let me tell you

  24   what my main problem is.  The original principal argument in

  25   support of bifurcation related to the attack on the prison



                                                                4096



   1   guard and the desire on Al-'Owhali's part that that not be

   2   brought out at a trial in which he is the defendant.  In the

   3   government's response, the government raises the issue whether

   4   if counsel for Al-'Owhali seeks to introduce as reasons why

   5   the death penalty should not be imposed the nature of maximum

   6   security and lack of dangerousness, that the government might

   7   then seek to introduce at the Al-'Owhali trial evidence of the

   8   attack on the guard by K.K. Mohamed, and if that were to

   9   occur, then the reason why bifurcation was granted in the

  10   first instance would really have disappeared, because then we

  11   would have two separate trials at each of which the jury would

  12   hear of the attack on the guard, and I don't know how one

  13   deals with that.

  14            Just in terms of what you just said about assurances

  15   that there is no overlap, I don't know how in a death penalty

  16   phase the court enforces such an understanding.

  17            Let's deal with the first matter, which is really my

  18   main concern, and that is, does the government foresee a

  19   circumstance under which it seeks to introduce at the

  20   Al-'Owhali death penalty phase evidence of the attack on the

  21   guard?

  22            MR. GARCIA:  Your Honor, it is definitely possible,

  23   as we said in the brief.  I don't want to overstate to the

  24   court how much evidence we could get in or would get in in an

  25   effort to have trials together.  I am trying to be as



                                                                4097
