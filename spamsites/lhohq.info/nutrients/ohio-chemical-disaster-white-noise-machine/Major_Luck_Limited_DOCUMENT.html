  14   in the Sudan, so he really couldn't know about these fatwahs

  15   or these informations that was given out.

  16            One of the good things about having more than one

  17   lawyer is that the other lawyer can be checking things out,

  18   and it turns out that all the photographic identifications

  19   that came in as exhibits, all the photographs that came in as

  20   exhibits in this case as al Qaeda, three came in with

  21   Mr. Al-Fadl and all the rest came in with Mr. Kherchtou.

  22            And the three that came in with Mr. Al-Fadl were --

  23   excuse me, take it back.  Four or five came in with

  24   Mr. Al-Fadl and I believe that they were all like Mr. Bin

  25   Laden and a couple of others, and I think they even brought in



                                                                5670



   1   Abu Hafs because he finally identified Abu Hafs from a certain

   2   picture.  Everything else came from Mr. Kherchtou.

   3            So if the government gets up and says, well,

   4   Mr. Kherchtou wouldn't have heard of it because he wasn't

   5   around the Sudan that much, I respectfully submit that the

   6   only person who was paying attention to anything going on was

   7   Mr. Kherchtou because Mr. Al-Fadl was doing his own thing and

   8   not paying attention to a lot what was going on and came here

   9   and told you things that he had no clue about.

  10            The government got up and told you one of the major

  11   pieces of evidence that Mr. El Hage, Wadih El Hage, either was

  12   al Qaeda or certainly was involved with al Qaeda is that he

  13   was the al Qaeda payroll person for a while.  I remember that.

  14   I remember the testimony back when Mr. Al-Fadl testified and I

  15   found the related testimony concerning Mr. Al-Fadl concerning

  16   payroll.

  17            Direct examination for Mr. Al-Fadl on page 249:

  18   "Q.  In 1991 was al Qubashi the Sudani in that office?

  19   "A.  Yes.

  20   "Q.  Did there come a time when al Qubashi left that office?

  21   "A.  Yes.

  22   "Q.  Do you know exactly when that was?

  23   "A.  I think June 9, 1993.

  24   "Q.  When he left that office, who moved into that office?

  25   "A.  Sheikh Sayyid el Masry.



                                                                5671



   1            And where did he get that information from?  He got

   2   it from Wadih El Hage.  Now we're talking about getting that

   3   money from Sheik Sayyid el Masry on McNimr street sometime

   4   after June 3, 1993.  He says, if you see lower down, how he

   5   did it.  Then further down, "He trained and he -- did he train

   6   anybody?"  This is two people, being Abu Quadashi and Wadih El

   7   Hage.  He trained them both to do it, to give the money.

   8            Next page.  And there was a file.  Of course he never

   9   identified anything of Mr. El Hage's file.  Never identified

  10   any personal information from Mr. El Hage's file.  Never even

  11   testified there existed an El Hage file.

  12            Now, if you look down at page 66, this is from Mr. Al

  13   Ridi.  And the dark lines are not the testimony, the dark

  14   lines are my summation to you that Mr. Al Ridi's testimony, I

  15   submit to you, is a lot more reliable than Mr. Al-Fadl's

  16   testimony.  So please don't think that that's part of the

  17   transcript.

  18   "Q.  When did he fly the plane into the United States?

  19   "A.  The early part of 1993.  Then he went to the office to

  20   get the accounting, to get the rest of his money.

  21   "Q.  Where did he go?

  22   "A.  He went to a nice area that was a residential area."

  23            We know from the testimony that the residential area

  24   is the Riyadh area, the area where Mr. Bin Laden moved his

  25   offices from McNimr Street to the Riyadh area.  I don't recall



                                                                5672



   1   the name because I didn't write it down, and the rest of the

   2   offices remained on McNimr Street.

   3   "Q.  And the offices there in the front, who was there?

   4   "A.  In the office in the front," next page, "was Wadih El

   5   Hage in a small desk."

   6            If Wadih El Hage, in the beginning of 1993, is now in

   7   the Riyadh area, how is he the al Qaeda paymaster in McNimr

   8   Street?  Well, he can't be.  And your choice is to accept the

   9   testimony of Mr. Al Ridi as to going to see the office where

  10   Mr. El Hage was at or believe the testimony of Mr. Al-Fadl as

  11   to Mr. El Hage became the payroll master of al Qaeda.

  12            I also ask you to reject the government's description

  13   of the role of Mr. El Hage as a gatekeeper.  He testified in

  14   1997 in the Grand Jury.  At that time he couldn't possibly

  15   know that Al-Fadl was cooperating.  At that time the

  16   government says he lied many times.  And what did he do?  He

  17   said that he was a personal secretary for Mr. Bin Laden at the

  18   times he wasn't traveling.

  19            Now, was that an answer to keep him out of trouble or

  20   was that just an honest answer?  And what did he do?  He made

  21   appointments.  Did he know that there was appointments made by

  22   somebody else that was "secret"?  Yes, he knew that because he

  23   didn't do them.  But he placed himself there, and as his books

  24   show, he was there when he went traveling and he was traveling

  25   a lot.  And as his books show, he made appointments for
