  24   means that it is always the government's burden to prove each

  25   of the elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable




                                                                6049


   1   doubt.

   2            If, after careful and impartial consideration of all

   3   of the evidence, or the lack of evidence, on a particular

   4   count, you have a reasonable doubt as to the defendant you are

   5   considering, it is your duty to find that defendant not guilty

   6   on that count.  On the other hand, if, after careful and

   7   impartial consideration of all the evidence on a particular

   8   count, you are satisfied of the guilt of the defendant you are

   9   considering beyond a reasonable doubt, you should find that

  10   defendant guilty on that count.

  11            The fact that one party called more witnesses and

  12   introduced more evidence than the other does not mean that you

  13   should necessarily find the facts in favor of the side

  14   offering the most witnesses.  By the same token, you do not

  15   have to accept the testimony of any witness who has not been

  16   contradicted or impeached if you find the witness not to be

  17   credible.  You have to decide which witnesses to believe and

  18   which facts are true.  To do this, you must look at all the

  19   evidence, drawing upon your own common sense and personal

  20   experience.

  21            In a moment I will discuss the criteria for

  22   evaluating credibility.  Let me say again, though, you should

  23   keep in mind that the burden of proof is always on the

  24   government.  The defendants are not required to call any

  25   witnesses or offer any evidence, since they are presumed to be




                                                                6050


   1   innocent.

   2            You have heard reference in the arguments of counsel

   3   in this case to the fact that certain investigative techniques

   4   were used by the government and that certain others were not

   5   used.  You may consider these facts in deciding whether the

   6   government has met its burden of proof because, as I have told

   7   you, you should look to all the evidence or lack of evidence

   8   in deciding whether a defendant is guilty.  However, you

   9   should understand that there is no legal requirement that the

  10   government use any of these specific investigative techniques

  11   to prove its case.  Your concern is to determine whether or

  12   not, on the evidence or lack of evidence, the government has

  13   proved the guilt of each of the defendants beyond a reasonable

  14   doubt.

  15            There are two types of evidence which you may

  16   properly use in deciding whether a defendant is guilty or not

  17   guilty.  One type of evidence is called direct evidence.

  18   Direct evidence is where a witness testifies about something
