  15            THE COURT:  Life is complicated enough.  Sort of

  16   sealed --

  17            MR. COHN:  I ask that it not be filed because I don't

  18   know -- I see no reason that the press shouldn't see it but

  19   later --

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  The order of business today were

  21   that Mr. Garcia and I would sit down and go through the

  22   letters and let counsel and the court know at the end of the

  23   today.

  24            THE COURT:  We have on our agenda now the Al-'Owhali

  25   in limine motion as to the two items, and can we schedule that



                                                                6240



   1   for Monday morning?  Tuesday morning maybe?  I don't want to

   2   have the -- the leitmotif of the proceedings about which the

   3   jury is deliberating now, with the Somalia stipulation which

   4   never occurred, there is no reason why we shouldn't address

   5   these things.

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  Could I let you know after lunch so

   7   we can figure out what we are doing?  We want to get this

   8   resolved.

   9            THE COURT:  All right.  There were issues raised also

  10   on behalf of Al-'Owhali with respect to discovery.  One was of

  11   the military, and then I was asked not to confront that issue

  12   because efforts were being made to resolve it consensually,

  13   efforts which I certainly encourage.  What is the status of

  14   that?

  15            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, the military last contacted

  16   me on Monday.  They said they would give me the information we

  17   reduced it down to.  I sent them another letter Wednesday.  At

  18   this juncture it is in the air.  I intend to go back and call

  19   them right now to find out what is the status.  They haven't

  20   called me back.

  21            THE COURT:  I have already set a date for the

  22   defendants listing mitigation factors and requests to charge.

  23            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, I assume that in that

  24   package you probably also want our proposed preliminary

  25   instructions to the jury, introduction to the penalty phase.



                                                                6241



   1            THE COURT:  On the 17th.  That is with respect to
