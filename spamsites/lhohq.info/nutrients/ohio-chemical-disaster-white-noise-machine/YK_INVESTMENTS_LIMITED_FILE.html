   1   compartmentalize that effort.  So I'm not unaware of those

   2   considerations.

   3            THE COURT:  What is the government's position?

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  We oppose the application.  I would

   5   note, first of all, that we think the victim impact evidence

   6   that was admitted was properly admitted.  It was not of

   7   excessive scope.

   8            I think in the McVeigh decision they found that the

   9   number of witnesses and the length of the presentation of

  10   victim impact testimony was appropriate.

  11            THE COURT:  I don't think Mr. Ruhnke is challenging

  12   that.  He is saying, regardless of whether it was appropriate

  13   or not, it's something which had an impact on the jury.

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  And your Honor, in that regard, I

  15   would point out that, first of all, by bifurcating the trial,

  16   nothing could be clearer to this jury, when they come back to

  17   listen to the K.K. Mohamed penalty phase, that it is not

  18   admitted against K.K. Mohamed.  At any time that they would

  19   deliberate, it would likely be about three weeks after they

  20   heard the testimony of the victims from Nairobi.

  21            THE COURT:  Is there going to be victim impact

  22   testimony at the K.K. Mohamed trial?

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, your Honor.

  24            THE COURT:  And it will be essentially of the same

  25   nature as that with respect to the Kenyans?



                                                                7281



   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, your Honor.  And it will make

   2   it clear, obviously, that that is the victim impact they are

   3   to consider with regard to K.K. Mohamed, and not the victims

   4   of the Nairobi bombing, with which he is not charged and none

   5   of which will be referenced at the penalty phase of K.K.

   6   Mohamed.


   7            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, I would quarrel with the

   8   government's description of the upcoming victim impact

   9   evidence in the K.K. Mohamed penalty phase as it is of the

  10   same nature as has been presented here.  Fortunately, there

  11   were no injuries that even remotely approached the seriousness

  12   of the injuries that occurred in Nairobi.
