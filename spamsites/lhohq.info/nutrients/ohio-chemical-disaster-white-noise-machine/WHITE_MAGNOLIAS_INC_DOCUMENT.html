<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">   5   any problem with the substance of it.  Whether we do it by

   6   separate paragraph or a footnote or so on, we'll consider.

   7   But I understand the point and I will try to accommodate it.

   8            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, in regard to those page after

   9   page of answering the question as to various dead people, I

  10   assume that you are leaving it the way it is, it is not an

  11   oversight, you rejected my request that it be chanced into

  12   one?

  13            THE COURT:  Yes.  No, I thought I indicated that the

  14   last time.  It was not an oversight.

  15            Anything else?

  16            MR. RICCO:  Your Honor, can I see you in the robing

  17   room with the government?

  18            THE COURT:  With the government?

  19            MR. RICCO:  Yes.

  20            THE COURT:  All right.  Surely.  Otherwise, we are

  21   adjourned until tomorrow.

  22            Should we meet before 10 a.m.?  Are there still some

  23   stipulations which at the last moment will be the subject --

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Why don't we meet at 9:45 and I

  25   think were ready to go.



                                                                5208



   1            THE COURT:  9:45 tomorrow.

   2            MR. COHN:  One other thing, your Honor, before our

   3   summation, we're using some Powerpoint charts and other things

   4   that we have created out of the evidence which have not been

   5   marked in evidence.  I expect to preview that with the

   6   government before my summation, and if there is any problem,

   7   we'll come to the court about it.

   8            THE COURT:  Very well.

   9            MR. COHN:  Just to tell you now that that's what

  10   we're going to use.

  11            THE COURT:  I will be available for that.

  12            MR. COHN:  I assume that we won't sum up until next

  13   week sometime.

  14            THE COURT:  Two and a half days.  I've got a chart

  15   someplace.

  16            MR. COHN:  Two and a half days gets us to Thursday

  17   afternoon and El Hage is going first, so it doesn't get me up

  18   until Monday or Tuesday.

  19            MR. DRATEL:  The government still anticipates --

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  I think the best thing to say,

  21   having predicted a nine to twelve-month trial, is after the

  22   end of the first day of summation, we'll tell you where we

  23   are.  In other words, if it's way ahead of pace, we'll give

  24   you a heads up so there is no surprise.

  25            THE COURT:  We're adjourned until tomorrow at 9:45.



                                                                5209
