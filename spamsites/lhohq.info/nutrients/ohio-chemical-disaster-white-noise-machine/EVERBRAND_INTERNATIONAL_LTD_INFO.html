<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  22   foot.  At that time I remember I was in so much pain.  I was

  23   not fully recuperated and I kept feeling that I would pass out

  24   any time.  We went to the police station.

  25            We looked through the names that were there, and we



                                                                6785



   1   could not get much from the list because they kept indicating

   2   a unknown African male.  I remember I was really annoyed and

   3   angry about it because I kept thinking that someone should

   4   know where Wilson is, he is not any unknown African male, he

   5   is my husband, someone should find him.  A policeman told us

   6   that we could find him -- there was another list of people

   7   whose names were missing.  I went through that list but I

   8   didn't get much from it.  It was then that we decided to look

   9   through the morgues.  We were told those who went to the

  10   different morgues.  Those who went to the other morgue were

  11   mostly family members and those at the city mortuary were

  12   unidentified.  That's where we headed around 10 a.m. Sunday,

  13   9th of August.  I recall it was a very cold, chilly morning.

  14   It was just the three of us, me, a friend and my

  15   brother-in-law.

  16            OK.  We entered the morgue through the back door, and

  17   there was a horrific scene there.  The first three bodies were

  18   badly bent, beyond recognition.  But I kept telling myself, I

  19   have to identify him.  I was going to go through this, I was

  20   not going to spend another night without knowing where he was.

  21   We went to a big room and there were bodies all over the

  22   floor.  I was feeling some relief, he wasn't there.  Someone

  23   said no, there is more bodies outside that room.  I went to

  24   that room and the fifth person from the door was Wilson.  He

  25   was lying with his head towards the ally and the feet towards



                                                                6786



   1   the wall.  I remember the first thing I looked at were the

   2   socks, and when I looked at his socks I followed the body

   3   downwards and right below my feet was his head.  At that time

   4   I recognized the shirt he had put on and the tie he had put

   5   on.  His face was badly damaged but it still was recognizable.

   6            Yeah, that's what happened that day.

   7   Q   Could you tell us what is the impact of your husband's

   8   death on you and your family?

   9   A   One thing, as I said, Wilson was a very charismatic man.

  10   He was just not -- he was not just a leader in the family, he

  11   was also a provider.  Besides that, Wilson, his parents looked

  12   up to him to do everything for them.  He was a first born son.

  13   He was well educated.  He was a hero to the family.  Everyone

  14   looked to him to help.  Everyone looked to him for advice.  He

  15   was a very courageous man.

  16            OK, after his death it was like we lost direction.

  17   It was not having a sense of direction.  I lost a mentor.  I

  18   lost somebody, my best friend.  His family missed him too.  Up

  19   till now my two children have not been able to cope with his

  20   death.  Every time I leave home it's like, mommy, are you

  21   going to come back or are you just going to leave and go where

  22   daddy went?  At that time my son was one and a half year old,

  23   and he has never become reconciled with the fact that this

  24   person just went and never came back.  He blames himself.  It

  25   is like he think I was a bad boy and that's why daddy left.



                                                                6787



   1   So when I leave, he say, mommy, don't leave, I'm going to be a

   2   good boy.  I say no, you're a good boy.  I am not leaving

   3   because you're a bad boy.

   4            MR. GARCIA:  No further questions.

   5            MR. BAUGH:  No questions of this witness.

   6            THE COURT:  Thank you.  You may step down.

   7            (Witness excused)

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  The government calls Dr. Todd Hess,

   9   HESS.

  10    TODD HESS,

  11        called as a witness by the government,

  12        having been duly sworn, testified as follows:
