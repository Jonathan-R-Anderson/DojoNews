<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  18            THE COURT:  You say "standards are met."  What is

  19   your understanding of the standard that has to be met?

  20            MR. SCHULZ:  I think, as your Honor stated earlier,

  21   the recent Supreme Court cases are clear that there is a First

  22   Amendment privilege that applies in criminal cases and there

  23   are sort of two steps to the analysis.  The first is that the

  24   defendant has to show that this is even appropriate discovery

  25   under 17C, which means that it has to be evidentiary and



                                                                4117



   1   relevant, and I think there are real questions about that.

   2            But even if they can get over that, they have the

   3   burden of showing that it is relevant to a significant issue

   4   in the case and not available elsewhere.  And the reason for

   5   that, as the Supreme Court made clear in the Gonzalez case

   6   that you cited earlier, was that the press is not to be use as

   7   a resource tool in situations like this.

   8            And I think that there are two fundamental problems

   9   here.  One is that it's hard to understand the relevance of

  10   this nine-year-old tape that has nothing to do with this

  11   proceeding to this case.  This is not -- I don't know that

  12   there is any allegation that this is tape that a particular

  13   defendant saw, that there's some claim that this particular

  14   viewing of this specific tape that was broadcast on CNN

  15   somehow insighted, there is nothing that like.  It doesn't

  16   involve the defendants here.  It's really a tangential

  17   relevancy at best.

  18            But even getting past that, the other part of the

  19   test is that it has to be unavailable elsewhere, and as has

  20   already been pointed out, there are many commercial houses

  21   where they can seek information about this bombing.  There is

  22   nothing unique that I have heard about the specific fact that

  23   this tape was shown on CNN.  And the defendants have an

  24   obligation first to see if they can get this from other

  25   sources other than journalists.



                                                                4118



   1            And it's not just the news houses, the photo shops

   2   that sell this type of information, but also the government is

   3   a party here, and if the government has tapes of these

   4   bombings, we would submit that they are another available

   5   source that should be exhausted before the press is looked to

   6   as an investigative arm.

   7            And I would just make one further point, which is in

   8   the letter that was submitted on the original subpoena that

   9   has not been withdrawn --

  10            THE COURT:  Yes.

  11            MR. SCHULZ:  -- that there are significant safety

  12   issues here that make this a rather unique circumstance.  CNN

  13   is in a different position than the other networks that have

  14   been subpoenaed because it has bureaus in the region.  The

  15   other networks do not.  There were specific safety issues,
