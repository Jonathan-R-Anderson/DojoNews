   1            (Deliberations resumed)

   2            (Time noted, 4:10 p.m.; jury not present)

   3            THE COURT:  The note from the jury reads:  "The jury

   4   appreciates the court's continued efforts to provide us the

   5   information we require in order to deliberate.  We would also

   6   like to request a few additional items:  Government's Exhibit

   7   660 -- chart of phone calls; Government's Exhibit 321, V1, V2,

   8   and V3 re El Hage.  WEHXS11 -- Bin Laden letters; GX310-74A.

   9   Since it is near the end of the day, we will not require the

  10   items until tomorrow."

  11            Any problem providing any of these?

  12            MR. KARAS:  No, Judge, there shouldn't be.  The first


  13   note asks for Government's Exhibit 310-74A, which we did

  14   provide.

  15            THE COURT:  And what is V1, 2 and 3?

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  Those are small notebooks that came in

  17   with the expert.

  18            THE COURT:  V?

  19            MR. SCHMIDT:  V.

  20            THE COURT:  Is tomorrow the day we begin at 11:00?

  21   Maybe a little earlier, maybe 10:30.

  22            MR. DRATEL:  Judge, how are you marking this note?

  23            THE COURT:  Each one has a separate date.  So this

  24   will be Court Exhibit Roman I of today's date.

  25            (Court's Exhibit I duly marked)



                                                                6259



   1            THE COURT:  How are we going to know whether we sent

   2   in Exhibit 310?

   3            MR. KARAS:  Someone is checking upstairs, your Honor.

   4   We should be able to know very shortly.

   5            Your Honor, our records upstairs did not have the

   6   original 310, so we did send it in.

   7            THE COURT:  That is GX310-74A.

   8            MR. KARAS:  I think we sent in both 310-74A and the

   9   translation as well, 74A-T.

  10            THE COURT:  My note to the jury says:  "Ladies and

  11   gentlemen, the exhibits you requested will be given to you
