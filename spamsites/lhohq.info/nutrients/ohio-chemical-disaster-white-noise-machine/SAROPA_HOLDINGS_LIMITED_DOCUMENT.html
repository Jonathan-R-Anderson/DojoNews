   6   charged in the indictment.

   7            In this regard, it is the government's burden to

   8   prove that the conduct of the defendant you are considering

   9   was the direct cause of the victim's death.  That means

  10   simply, the government must prove that the defendant inflicted

  11   an injury or injuries upon the victim from which the victim

  12   died, or that the defendant aided and abetted another person

  13   to do so.

  14            The definition of "aiding and abetting" that was

  15   provided to you earlier in Counts 5 and 6 is also applicable

  16   to the element of these counts.

  17       Recall with respect to Counts 9 through 221 and defendant

  18   Odeh, the government's theory is that he aided and abetted the

  19   commission of the offenses.  The government does not allege

  20   that defendant Odeh physically carried out the crimes charged

  21   in those counts.

  22            As I have already explained to you, to satisfy their

  23   burden as to these counts, the government must establish

  24   beyond a reasonable doubt each of the six elements that I am

  25   now explaining to you.




                                                                6151


   1            The second element that the government must prove

   2   beyond a reasonable doubt is that the killing occurred in the

   3   course of an attack on a federal facility.  The term "federal

   4   facility" means a building or part thereof owned or leased by

   5   the federal government, where federal employees are regularly

   6   present for the purpose of performing their official duties.

   7            The third element that the government must prove

   8   beyond a reasonable doubt is that in the course of an attack

   9   on a federal facility, if you should find that one occurred,

  10   the defendant you are considering knowingly used a firearm or

  11   other dangerous weapon.

  12            To use a firearm or other dangerous weapon in an

  13   attack means to use it in such a way that it was an integral

  14   part of the attack.

  15            The term "firearm" includes, among other things, any

  16   destructive device.  A "destructive device" is defined to

  17   include an explosive, incendiary or poison gas bomb; an

  18   explosive, incendiary or poison gas grenade; an explosive,

  19   incendiary or poison gas rocket; an explosive, incendiary or

  20   poison gas mine; or any similar device.

  21            The term "dangerous weapon" means a weapon, device,

  22   instrument, material or substance, animate or inanimate, that

  23   is used for or is readily capable of causing death or bodily

  24   injury.

  25            To satisfy this element, you must find that the




                                                                6152


   1   defendant you are considering knowingly used the firearm or
