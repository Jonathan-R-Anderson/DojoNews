  10   criticize the Americans for taking custody of Mr. Mohamed.

  11   However, interpreting their own law and their own

  12   Constitution, the South African High Court, the highest court

  13   in South Africa, ruled that Mr. Mohamed should not have been

  14   turned over to the Americans unless it was promised that he

  15   not face the death penalty.

  16            The final things we will talk about and I will

  17   reserve talking about, Mr. Mohamed's personal characteristics.

  18   This is to tell you that you are not asked to consider

  19   executing or imprisoning a symbol or a cliche or some kind of

  20   cipher.  He is a human being with human qualities that are

  21   good, that are bad.  The choices he has made have brought him

  22   to that point where the only decision left in his life is do

  23   we kill him or do we lock him up in a prison away from society

  24   for the rest of his life.

  25            It is unique, individualized judgment, as I have



                                                                7495



   1   said.  I'm going to close with an example.  It used to be in

   2   this country when people were executed by a firing squad that

   3   a member of the firing squad, one member, would have blanks

   4   placed in their rifle.  And the reason for that was that if it

   5   ever turned out that the person was innocent or turned out,

   6   even more importantly, that they should not have been

   7   sentenced to death, that something went wrong with the process

   8   and they should not have been executed, that the person could,

   9   any member of the squad could take the view that, well, maybe

  10   I had the blank and maybe I'm not responsible for killing this

  11   person.

  12            As you well know, all 12 of you must vote for

  13   execution if execution is to take place.  The law does not

  14   give any one of you a blank vote.  I'm asking all of you to

  15   withhold your vote for death.  I am asking all of you to treat

  16   Mr. Mohamed as a unique individual, to look into your heart,

  17   and to vote for a sentence of life imprisonment.

  18            Thank you very much.

  19            THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Ruhnke.

  20            We will take a five-minute recess.
