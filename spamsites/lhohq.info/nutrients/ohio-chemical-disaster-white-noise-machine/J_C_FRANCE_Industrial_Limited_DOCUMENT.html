   7   Q   Is Walter Reade back in the States?

   8   A   Yes, it is.

   9   Q   Did there come a time after your treatment at the various

  10   hospitals when you returned to Nairobi?

  11   A   About five, six weeks after, I returned to Nairobi.

  12   Q   Can you tell the jury what happened in February of 1999.

  13   Did you come to leave Nairobi again?

  14   A   I left Nairobi in February '89 again.  I had gotten to the

  15   point where I was doing everything I could to keep myself in

  16   control.  I felt like as long as I was in control of

  17   everything that went on around me then I could deal with what

  18   had happened.  In February of '89, I realized that I couldn't.

  19   I was medicated and sent out.

  20   Q   And you came back home?

  21   A   I came back home.

  22   Q   Can you tell the jury how you're doing now.

  23   A   I have nightmares.  Sometimes I see people who I know have

  24   died.  I can be walking up a hallway and look off in the

  25   distance and think someone that I had known that died is



                                                                6779



   1   coming towards me.  Back last fall they had a high school

   2   homecoming about two blocks from my house.  They set off

   3   fireworks.  It scared me so bad that I wound up in the hallway

   4   plastered against the wall.  My husband told me later, he said

   5   you looked like a deer who had been caught in headlights.  I

   6   couldn't move.

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Thank you.  I have nothing further.

   8            MR. BAUGH:  We have no questions for Mrs. Sparks.

   9            THE COURT:  Thank you, ma'am.

  10            (Witness excused)

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  I think this might be an appropriate

  12   time for the break, Judge.

  13            THE COURT:  We will take our midafternoon break at

  14   this time.

  15            (Recess)

  16            THE COURT:  The government may call the next witness.

  17            MR. GARCIA:  The government calls Dorine Ruto,

  18   R-U-T-O.

  19    DOREEN RUTO,

  20        called as a witness by the government,

  21        having been duly sworn, testified as follows:

  22   DIRECT EXAMINATION

  23   BY MR. GARCIA:

  24   Q   Ma'am, if I could ask you to speak as loudly as you can

  25   and to lean a little bit towards the microphone, although you



                                                                6780



   1   don't have to speak into it.

   2            Miss Ruto, was your husband killed in the Nairobi

   3   bombing on August 7, 1998?

   4   A   Yes.

   5   Q   What was his name?

   6   A   Wilson Kipkorir Mutani.

   7   Q   How old was your husband when he died?

   8   A   He was to turn 33 that week.

   9   Q   How long were you married?

  10   A   We were married for nine years.

  11   Q   Did you have children?

  12   A   Yes.

  13   Q   How many?

  14   A   Two children.  Boys.

  15   Q   How old were they?

  16   A   They are now 12 and 5.

  17            MR. GARCIA:  The government would now offer

  18   Government's Exhibit 2113 and display it, with your Honor's

  19   permission.

  20            THE COURT:  Yes.

  21            (Government Exhibit 2113 received in evidence)

  22   Q   Is that a photo of your husband there?

  23   A   Yes, it is.

  24   Q   Would you tell us something about your husband, what he

  25   was like.



                                                                6781



   1   A   When I first met Wilson, first of all, he was a very

   2   handsome man.  He was very charismatic.  He was very

   3   intelligent.  I met him in college.  He was in his second

   4   year, doing his stadia in biology.  He was a very kind man.

   5   When we got married, he appeared to me as a very good father,

   6   a very good husband.

   7            One thing, in our tradition, most of the time men are

   8   not supposed to take part in the bringing of babies, things

   9   like changing nappies.  It wasn't a man's job.  But this was a

  10   man who would change nappies and even feed the babies.  The

  11   two children I had, I had them through Caesarian section.

  12   During that time when I would be recuperating, he would take

  13   care of the children and take care of me.  He was my nursemaid

  14   most of the time that I was sick.
