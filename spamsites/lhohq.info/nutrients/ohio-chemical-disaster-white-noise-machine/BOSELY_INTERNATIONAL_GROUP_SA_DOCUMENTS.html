   3   read about this in the New York Times.  Yes, we did that too,

   4   and we have been hitting our heads.

   5            More importantly, not only they don't want to come, I

   6   don't want to bring in a cooperative witness.  This trial

   7   is -- people are afraid of it.  I will tell you right now,

   8   people who are trying to get the sanctions lifted in Iraq

   9   don't like the fact that they get called terrorists, and they

  10   don't want to have anything to do with the terrorists.  They

  11   call, quote, terrorists detrimental to the cause.  Which I can

  12   understand.

  13            THE COURT:  One can hardly say that is an irrational

  14   position.

  15            MR. BAUGH:  One who is into peace and lifting the

  22            MR. BAUGH:  Ms. Morales and I spent the afternoon

  23   with probably -- with an American who speaks Arabic, who has

  24   memorized the Koran, who is a learned professor, who consults

  25   with the president of the United States on these issues, and



                                                                6903



   1   he told me that he would not voluntarily testify during this

   2   type of trial and that I should not even think of subpoenaing

   3   him.  It was a very nice lunch.  We spent, what, three hours

   4   with him and members of his staff, and we went over our
