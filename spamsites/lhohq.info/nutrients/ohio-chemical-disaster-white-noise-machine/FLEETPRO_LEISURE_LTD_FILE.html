   1   defendant El Hage or his wife, April, with a representative of

   2   the United States.  These conversations are not being offered

   3   or received in evidence as evidence of the truth of anything

   4   said to the agents or said to either of the El Hages.  They

   5   are being offered and are being received solely to show that

   6   the El Hages were in communication with representatives of the

   7   United States while they were in Kenya, and to reflect the

   8   general tone and nature of the conversations.  They are being

   9   offered and received for no other purpose.

  10            Mr. Schmidt.

  11            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I also ask that the English

  12   transcriptions be published to the jury as they go.

  13            THE COURT:  Yes.  You may proceed.

  14            Why don't you offer in one fell swoop all of those

  15   that you are going to play, and they are all subject to this

  16   statement to the jury and will all be received in one fell

  17   swoop, subject to the limitations just stated.

  18            What exhibits are they?

  19            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, it's WEHX-W68E, a telephone

  20   call --

  21            THE COURT:  Just 68.  Do that later before each one

  22   is played, just give the exhibits, 68E, 54 --

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  Excuse me, it's W68, W54, W55, W56,

  24   W49, W57 and W69, and before each one is WEHX for "Wadih El

  25   Hage exhibit."



                                                                4543



   1            THE COURT:  Yes.  Those two, four, six, seven, they

   2   are received subject to the direction which I just stated to

   3   the jury.

   4            (Defendant El Hage Exhibits WEHX-W68, WEHX-W54,

   5   WEHX-W55, WEHX-W56, WEHX-W49, WEHX-W57 and WEHX-W69 received

   6   in evidence)

   7            MR. SCHMIDT:  The first one is August 23, 1997.

   8            (Tape played)

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  The next telephone conversation will be

  10   September 11, 1997 at approximately 6:55.

  11            (Tape played)

  12            THE COURT:  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll

  13   take up at that point tomorrow.

  14            MR. SCHMIDT:  Can you remind the jury to shut these

  15   off?

  16            THE COURT:  Yes, the jury is reminded to shut them

  17   off.

  18            I have something else to tell you, and that is this:

  19   I have heretofore asked that you not read, watch, listen to or

  20   discuss with anyone anything related to this case, and I know

  21   you understand that and are complying with it.

  22            I would now like to broaden that and ask you, to the

  23   extent to which it is reasonably possible, that you avoid

  24   reading, watching or listening to anything in connection with

  25   the Timothy McVeigh case.  The Timothy McVeigh case is going



                                                                4544



   1   to receive a great deal of publicity in the next several

   2   weeks, and I know it's going to be hard to avoid it, but I ask

   3   that you make every effort just not to read or listen or watch

   4   anything with respect to the Timothy McVeigh case.

   5            Other than that, my only other comment is, have a

   6   good evening.

   7            (Jury excused)

   8            THE COURT:  We'll take a five-minute recess and then

   9   we'll proceed with the charging conference.  Whether or not

  10   the defendants are present is a matter of their choice.

  11            MR. COHN:  We'll ask, your Honor --

  12            THE COURT:  The record should be clear they have a

  13   right to be here if they wish.

  14            MR. RUHNKE:  Judge, my client wishes to be excused at

  15   this charge conference.

  16            MR. COHN:  Mr. Al-'Owhali asks to be excused.

  17            MR. SCHMIDT:  Mr. El Hage is going to stay.

  18            (Recess)

  19            (In open court; jury not present)

  20            THE COURT:  All right.  I have in front of me the

  21   various submissions by the defendants with respect to the

  22   second working draft as of April 19, 2001, 5 p.m. proposed

  23   charge to the jury, which we'll mark as --

  24            MR. COHN:  Excuse me, your Honor, since

  25   Mr. Al-'Owhali, I've just been advised that since



                                                                4545



   1   Mr. Al-'Owhali is not allowed to go back because Mr. El Hage

   2   is still here he wants to come back out, because he can't go

   3   back to the --

   4            THE COURT:  So they all have to come back.

   5            MR. COHN:  I was just told that.  I don't know that

   6   for a fact.

   7            THE COURT:  I maintain the position that for

   8   logistical reasons they all go back or they all stay, and I'm
