  21   A.  I bought it as I said, I finished the, I reconditioned --

  22   well, actually I refurbished it completely, and the avionic

  23   equipment, updated the version of avionics and also new paint.

  24   And we took off from Dallas-Fort Worth to Khartoum.

  25   Q.  Did you actually fly the plane yourself from the United



                                                                566



   1   States to Khartoum?

   2   A.  Yes, I did.

   3   Q.  Can you tell us the route just generally the route that

   4   you took?

   5   A.  The airplane had a range of about 1500 miles.  You cannot

   6   really cross the Atlantic with that range.  So we had to go up

   7   north almost to the Pole and cross down to mainland.  So we

   8   took the first one was Dallas-Fort Worth, Slte. St. Marie at

   9   the Canadian borders.  From there on to a place 67 lat north,

  10   I think it's Furbisher Bay, Canada and then from Fervershaw

  11   Bay, Canada to Iceland to Lucan, Rome, Cairo, Cairo, Khartoum.

  12   Q.  How long did it take you to fly the plane from Dallas

  13   through the various stops to Khartoum, Sudan?

  14   A.  It should have taken two days at the most but actually we

  15   had some technical problems due to the bad weather in

  16   Fervershaw Bay.  It was minus 65, so we lost hydraulics and we

  17   had a crack in all the window.

  18   Q.  How long did it actually take you to get there?

  19   A.  About a week.

  20   Q.  Do you recall approximately when was that you flew the

  21   plane from the United States to Sudan?

  22   A.  The early part of 1993.

  23   Q.  And what happened when you arrived in Khartoum with the

  24   plane?

  25   A.  In the sense of if you can explain the question please.



                                                                567



   1   Q.  You land the at Khartoum with the plane.  What do you do?

   2   A.  Nothing.  I just parked the airplane, took permission in

   3   the civil aviation authorities there and I was met with Wadih

   4   and I'm not sure maybe another driver or so.

   5   Q.  And where did you go with Wadih and the driver?

   6   A.  We went to Wadih's house.

   7   Q.  And what did you do there?

   8   A.  Had lunch with him.

   9   Q.  Did there come a time when you met Usama Bin Laden on that

  10   trip?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  When was that?

  13   A.  It must have been the same day, at night, we were offered

  14   dinners on his behalf.

  15   Q.  And where was the dinner held?

  16   A.  At his guest house.

  17   Q.  And who was present for the dinner?

  18   A.  Quite a few people, but people that I could identify were

  19   me, Wadih, Usama, a guy by the name of Abu Jaffer.  I think

  20   also another guy by the name of Loay, and, yes, that's the

  21   names I could recall.

  22   Q.  We're spelling L-O-A-Y and J-A-F-F-E-R.  Do you know what

  23   nationality Abu Jaffer was?

  24   A.  Yes, he's from Iraq.

  25   Q.  What role did Abu Jaffer play at the dinner?



                                                                568



   1   A.  This was my first time to be introduced to him and he led

   2   the prayers at the night.

   3   Q.  And let me show you what has been previously received in

   4   evidence a number of photographs beginning with Government

   5   Exhibit 100 in evidence.  If we could display that on the

   6   screens.

   7            Do you recognize the person depicted in Government

   8   Exhibit 100?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Who is that?

  11   A.  Usama Bin Laden.

  12   Q.  If we could display Government Exhibit 101 in evidence.

  13   Do you recognize the person depicted in Government Exhibit

  14   101?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  Who is that?

  17   A.  Abu Hafs.

  18   Q.  How do you know Abu Hafs?

  19   A.  I met him briefly in Peshawar, and thereafter I think he

  20   must have been over the dinner, too, with Usama.

  21   Q.  Do you know what nationality he is?

  22   A.  Egyptian.
