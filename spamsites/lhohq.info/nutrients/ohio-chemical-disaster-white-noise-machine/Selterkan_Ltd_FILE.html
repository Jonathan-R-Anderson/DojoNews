   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  At this time we would display two

   3   pages from Government's Exhibit 518.

   4            The entry, if it is appearing on people's screens,

   5   should be for an Abu Bakr Khalfan, A-B-U, B-A-K-R,

   6   K-H-A-L-F-A-N, for 1-8-98.

   7            The second entry that will be displayed is from a

   8   later page, and if we could focus on the page reflecting

   9   August 4 entry, 4/8/98, the top entry on the page, which

  10   indicates Abdul Basit, and on the right, the far column

  11   indicates 0011061 as the number.  If we can enlarge the page

  12   again and indicate that the number 0011061 appears under

  13   passport number or i.d. card in the name Abdul Basit and the

  14   date of arrival is 4/8/98.  This is from the register of the

  15   Hilltop Hotel.

  16            I would now return to a stipulation marked as

  17   Government's Exhibit 50.

  18            JUROR:  There is something falling off the ledge

  19   here.

  20            THE COURT:  What is it?  Dirt?

  21            JUROR:  It is on the chairs, Judge.

  22            THE COURT:  Why don't we take a recess and I will get

  23   the building maintenance to see what it is.

  24            (Recess)

  25            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry for the


                  SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS (212) 805-0300
                                                                3580

   1   inconvenience.  It has all been dusted and checked, and it is

   2   just a further illustration of how difficult it is sometimes

   3   to know how long something is going to take.

   4            Mr. Fitzgerald.

   5            MR. FITZGERALD:  Thank you, Judge.  Returning to the

   6   stipulation marked Government's Exhibit 50, paragraph 7.  It

   7   is stipulated by the parties that Government's Exhibits 519A

   8   through 519C are true and accurate copies of the business

   9   records of the Eagle Travel agency in Mombasa, Kenya.  It is

  10   further stipulated that if called to testify, the employee at

  11   Eagle Travel who sold the tickets in the name of Abdull Bast

  12   Awadah, spelled A-B-D-U-L-L, capital B-A-S-T, capital

  13   A-W-A-D-A-H, and Fahid Masalam, F-A-H-I-D, M-A-S-A-L-A-M,

  14   would testify that both tickets were purchased by Fahad,

  15   F-A-H-A-D, Masalam, M-A-S-A-L-A-M, on August 3, 1998, in

  16   exchange for total payment of $936 cash.

  17            Government's Exhibits 519A through 519C may be

  18   admitted in evidence.

  19            Your Honor, I would offer 519A through C at this

  20   time.

  21            THE COURT:  Received.
