  12            MR. FITZGERALD:  With regard to Iraqui water

  13   treatment I don't know the purpose for which it is offered and

  14   I do not understand there to be a contention that is something

  15   to which Mr. Al-'Owahli had access at the time he chose to

  16   participate in the crime.

  17            MR. BAUGH:  In 1991 immediately prior to the Gulf War

  18   there was a memo sent from the Defense Intelligence Agency to

  19   various commands of the United States military and the United

  20   Kingdom and I believe also to Turkey indicating -- I can't

  21   find my copy -- indicating that in the event of hostilities

  22   between the United States and Iraq, that Iraq was uniquely

  23   vulnerable due to the fact they only had two sources of fresh

  24   water, the Tiber and Euphrates rivers, and it was dependent on

  25   water purification, plant materials and gases, namely chlorine



                                                                6952



   1   gases in 1991 -- here it is.  It was dependent upon foreign --

   2   it is dated 18 January 91.

   3            First paragraph.  Iraqi depends on importing

   4   specialized equipment and some chemicals to purify its water

   5   supply, most of which is heavily mineralized and frequently

   6   brackish to saline.  If you read through they talk about the

   7   advantages of destroying the water purification system and

   8   what would happen to it, and then it goes on to point out at

   9   paragraph -- give me one moment please, your Honor --

  10   paragraph 11, they talk about the waters are laden with

  11   certain diseases at paragraph 11.

  12            THE COURT:  DIA is who?

  13            MR. BAUGH:  Defense Intelligence Agency.  In fact,

  14   when I sent a subpoena to the Department of Defense they told

  15   me, go ahead an pull it off the Internet, it's been

  16   declassified, it's out there.

  17            THE COURT:  Yes.

  18            MR. BAUGH:  And there is a statement in here, if you

  19   give me one moment to find it that says, by the destruction of

  20   this the United States can create epidemic of certain

  21   illnesses and --

  22            THE COURT:  Paragraph 27.

  23            MR. BAUGH:  Thank you, your Honor.  Yes, it's at the

  24   bottom of the page.  It says, the whole paragraph indicates

  25   that unless the population were careful to boil water before



                                                                6953



   1   consumption, particularly since the sewage treatment system

   2   will suffer, locally produced food and medicine could be

   3   contaminated.

   4            THE COURT:  This is an analysis of the vulnerability

   5   of Iraq in the event of military action because of its water

   6   supply.

   7            MR. BAUGH:  It would appear, your Honor, based upon

   8   60 Minutes tapes and people who have been there that their

   9   water purification has been destroyed, and according to the

  10   World Health Organization it is primarily responsible for the

  11   deaths of the children.

  12            And I would also call the Court's attention to

  13   another document which we tendered to the Court today, namely,

  14   gave the Court a copy of the Geneva Convention which indicates

  15   that even in times of war targeting -- protocol one to the

  16   Geneva Convention 1977 specifically paragraph 54 states:  It

  17   is prohibited -- I'm paraphrasing.  It is prohibited to attack

  18   objects of sustenance to survival of the civilian population

  19   such as food stuff, drinking water, installations and supplies

  20   and irrigation works for the specific purpose of denying them

  21   for their sustenance, sustenance to the civilian population.
