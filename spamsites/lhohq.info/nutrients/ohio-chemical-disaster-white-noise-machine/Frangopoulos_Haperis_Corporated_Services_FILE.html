  19   Q.  At some point you and other officers began to go back

  20   through that U-shaped hallway past the lieutenant's office,

  21   right?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And you're working your way backs towards Cell No. 6?

  24   A.  Uh-huh.

  25   Q.  Correct?




                                                                7769


   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  And at some point someone picked up a plexiglass shield,

   3   and I think you said that was Jenkins; is that fair to say?

   4   A.  Yes, sir.

   5   Q.  And isn't it true that Jenkins then handed you that

   6   plexiglass shield?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Pardon me?

   9   A.  He handed me part of it.  At this point I couldn't tell

  10   you if I had it all.  I did have part of that shield.

  11   Q.  Well, you filled out a report in connection with this

  12   case, didn't you?

  13   A.  Yes, I did.

  14   Q.  And that report was a report that's required to be filled

  15   out as part of Bureau of Prisons policies and procedures,

  16   right?

  17   A.  Depends what kind of report you're talking about, sir.  I

  18   don't know.

  19   Q.  It's a memorandum from the United States Department of

  20   Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Metropolitan Correctional

  21   Center, New York.  For identification it's 35167-A.

  22   A.  Yes, that's a memorandum of my recollections of that day.

  23   Q.  And you actually read that report once it was typed up,

  24   right?

  25   A.  Yes, I did.




                                                                7770


   1   Q.  And then you signed it, and by signing you are saying

   2   what's in here is true?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  If there was an error in this document, you wouldn't sign

   5   it, right?  You would say, wait, there's a mistake, let's get

   6   it changed and then I will sign it?

   7   A.  I'm the one who wrote that, sir.  If that's written by me,

   8   if my name is on top of it, it's written by me.

   9   Q.  It's not handwritten, but it's signed by you?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  So by signing, you verify what is in it is accurate?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  Don't you say in that report that Officer Jenkins handed

  14   you a plexiglass grill cover?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  Okay.  Now you come out into the area in front of Cell No.

  17   6 and you don't see Salim, do you?

  18   A.  No, I do not.

  19   Q.  Do you ever see Salim, other than the fleeting glimpse you

  20   got of someone through the door?

  21   A.  Not to the end, no, sir.

  22   Q.  So, at that time, you still haven't seen him, unless that

  23   was him you got a fleeting glimpse of?

  24   A.  Right.

  25   Q.  But you do see Khalfan Mohamed?




                                                                7771


   1   A.  Yes, I do.

   2   Q.  And he's backed into a corner about as far as away from

   3   you as he can get, right?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And you have seen him, right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And you see him look in your direction?

   8   A.  Yes, I do.

   9   Q.  And you're there, correct?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  And Jenkins is there, correct?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And Maiden was there?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  All three of you, and Khalfan Mohamed is in this fairly

  16   small area in front of Cell No. 6?
