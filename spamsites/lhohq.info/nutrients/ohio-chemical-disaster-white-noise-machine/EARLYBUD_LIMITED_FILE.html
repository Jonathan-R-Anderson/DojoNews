  24   A.  No, actually, in proper management sense.  If you don't

  25   have any expertise in certain fields, you should not make



                                                                611



   1   decisions because then it will be an ill decision.

   2   Q.  Does that have to do with the money as well as just in

   3   terms of battlefield management?

   4   A.  That's what I'm saying.  If you are a financier, you could

   5   just pay the money, of course, to get the credit in the sight

   6   of God.  However, if you don't have any expertise in certain

   7   areas, it would be best not to give any decision making -- not

   8   to be part of the decision making.

   9   Q.  And the decision thinking that you are talking about is

  10   essentially military?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And you thought that his lack of military experience

  13   was -- withdrawn -- that he lacked enough military experience

  14   to make military decisions?

  15   A.  To the extent he was dangerous.

  16   Q.  Yes.  To the extent that it may cost the lives of some of

  17   the people working under him following his orders?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  But when you went back to Peshawar in the late 80s to

  20   sight the scopes on the rifles, in fact that was for Bin

  21   Laden's organization, correct, or his men?

  22   A.  That was to my surprise.  The deal initially was -- well,

  23   again, if you don't mind, I'm just going to take you a step

  24   back.

  25   Q.  I don't know.  I think if you just let me ask the



                                                                612



   1   questions.

   2   A.  Sure.

   3   Q.  We'll just keep it --

   4   A.  Sure.

   5   Q.  -- that way.

   6            It was supposed to be split a different way, correct?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  But then, ultimately, more went to Bin Laden than you had

   9   thought would happen?

  10   A.  Correct.

  11   Q.  And but you went back and you, even after you found out

  12   that Mr. Bin Laden had the rifles, you sighted the scopes for

  13   them?

  14   A.  Because it all happened when I got there, actually.

  15   Q.  But you did it?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  And then when you were asked by Mr. El Hage to purchase

  18   the plane, you went forward with that as a commercial, purely

  19   commercial business transaction, correct?

  20   A.  Absolutely.

  21   Q.  And the same is true when you returned a month or two

  22   later to make the flight to Nairobi?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  And the same is true when you came from Cairo to go back

  25   to the Sudan to try to fly the plane again a year and a half



                                                                613



   1   later?

   2   A.  That's correct.

   3   Q.  And all those were purely commercial transactions, having

   4   nothing to do with anything else?

   5   A.  No.

   6   Q.  And this was despite your earlier disagreements and

   7   reservations about Mr. Bin Laden, correct?

   8   A.  Because then the issue was not in existence anymore.  He
