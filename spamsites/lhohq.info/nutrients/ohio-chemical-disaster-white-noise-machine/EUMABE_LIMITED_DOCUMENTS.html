   1   their own initiative have determined to leave the courtroom

   2   open during these proceedings and on behalf of the press I

   3   express our appreciation.

   4            The court has before it the request made on behalf of

   5   K.K. Mohammed for discovery material set forth in letter of

   6   Mr. Ruhnke dated May 2 and the 10th, and the government's

   7   response dated May 7.  Do counsel wish to be heard on that

   8   request?

   9            MR. RUHNKE:  I have no desire to be heard beyond what

  10   was said in the moving papers.  On behalf of the government, I

  11   know Mr. Garcia has been handling the issues and he is not

  12   here in court.

  13            MR. FITZGERALD:  If you would like to hear from the

  14   government, I have just sent Ms. Grant to beep Mr. Garcia.

  15            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, we would join in that Mr.

  16   Ruhnke's request.

  17            THE COURT:  What I would really like to do is make a

  18   list of all the open matters so that we utilize the time while

  19   this jury is deliberating and that we do not run into delays

  20   or last minute matters.  I received two letters from Mr. Cohn,

  21   neither of which I believe calls for any action or response on

  22   the part of the government.  Am I wrong in that respect?

  23            MR. COHN:  Yes.  I have asked that certain evidence

  24   that the government intends to offer at the penalty phase,

  25   should one occur, be ruled inadmissible.  So obviously the



                                                                6239



   1   government ought to, if they want to respond, be given an

   2   opportunity.

   3            THE COURT:  Is the government prepared to respond?

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  Not at this time, your Honor.  We

   5   told defense counsel that with regard to the photographs we

   6   would go through and designate which photographs we might use,

   7   and obviously we will not offer anything without showing it to

   8   defense counsel first.

   9            MR. COHN:  No.  The two letters that the judge is

  10   referring to are the letter about the El Hage incident in

  11   court and Pepe as part of the government's rebuttal, should we

  12   put forward certain information.  I would ask that that last

  13   letter be sort of sealed.  So I think we ought to deal with

  14   that in a different place.

  15            THE COURT:  Life is complicated enough.  Sort of

  16   sealed --

  17            MR. COHN:  I ask that it not be filed because I don't

  18   know -- I see no reason that the press shouldn't see it but
