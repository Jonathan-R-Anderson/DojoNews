  15            With respect to the gateway factors, you have

  16   answered that you have unanimously found the gateway factors

  17   to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt with regard to

  18   all of the capital counts, and you made a similar finding with

  19   respect to the statutory aggravating factors.

  20            With respect to the non-statutory aggravating

  21   factors, you do not unanimously find that the defendant poses

  22   a continuing and serious threat to the life and safety of

  23   others with whom he will come in contact.  You do find that

  24   the non-statutory aggravating factors B and C have been proven

  25   beyond a reasonable doubt.



                                                                8758


   1            With respect to the mitigating factors, with respect

   2   to A, ten jurors so found; B, eleven jurors; C, nine jurors;

   3   E, nine jurors; F, twelve jurors; no jurors found as to G;

   4   nine as to H; twelve as to I; seven as to J; ten as to L.

   5            You have found as two additional mitigating factors

   6   that K.K. Mohamed's last psychological report showed that

   7   danger of harm to others was low, and nine jurors so found.

   8            THE FORELADY:  Correct.

   9            THE COURT:  And you also found as a mitigating factor

  10   that life imprisonment was a harsher punishment than death,

  11   and three jurors so found.

  12            THE FORELADY:  Yes.

  13            THE COURT:  And with respect to sentence, you are

  14   unable to reach a unanimous verdict either in favor of a life

  15   sentence or in favor of death sentence for any of the capital

  16   counts.  You understand that the consequence of this is that

  17   Khalfan Khamis Mohamed will be sentenced to life imprisonment

  18   without the possibility of release.

  19            THE FORELADY:  Correct.

  20            THE COURT:  And have each of you put your number on

  21   the last sheet, indicating that that reflects your unanimous
