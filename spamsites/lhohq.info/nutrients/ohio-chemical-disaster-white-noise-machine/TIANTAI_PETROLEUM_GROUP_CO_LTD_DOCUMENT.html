   1   A   How many times?

   2   Q   Why don't you just do it two times.

   3   A   (Witness complies.)

   4            THE COURT:  You want it written in English?

   5   Q   No, no, if you could write it in Arabic.

   6            Now, could you skip a couple of lines and write the

   7   name Alice in Arabic.

   8   A   (Witness complies.)

   9   Q   And could you is skip a couple of lines and write the name

  10   Allen in Arabic.

  11   A   (Witness complies.)

  12            THE COURT:  How are you spelling Allen?

  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  Excuse me?

  14            THE COURT:  How are you spelling Allen?

  15            MR. SCHMIDT:  I believe it's phonetic.

  16            THE COURT:  All right.

  17   Q   When you write a word that I ask you to write, especially

  18   a name, from English to Arabic, do you write it phonetically?

  19   A   Yes.

  20   Q   And would it be accurate to say that when you are

  21   translating from Arabic to English, the spelling of the word

  22   in English can vary, depending on the individual translator?

  23   A   From English to Arabic?

  24   Q   From Arabic to English.

  25   A   Yes, sir.



                                                                3701



   1   Q   Sometimes, for example, the Q sound is also written with a

   2   K?

   3   A   Yes, sir.

   4   Q   So when you are writing Allen, you are writing it

   5   phonetically into Arabic; is that correct?

   6   A   Yes.

   7            THE COURT:  We'll mark that C for identification, Mr.

   8   Schmidt?

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.  What number are we up to?

  10   W-H-X-H.

  11   Q   Actually, would you write one more name on the bottom.  If

  12   you could write Alice?

  13   A   I wrote Alice.

  14   Q   I mean Annie.  I'm sorry.

  15            THE COURT:  Annie?

  16   A   (Witness complies.)

  17            THE COURT:  So that sheet contains Anas written twice

  18   and then Alice, Allen and Annie, is that what you have

  19   written?

  20            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.

  21            THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

  22   Q   I see you have --

  23            THE COURT:  Is the English there, also?

  24            MR. SCHMIDT:  There is no English on there now.  Why

  25   don't we have the witness write down the English.



                                                                3702



   1            THE COURT:  What is the exhibit number?

   2            MR. SCHMIDT:  H.

   3            THE COURT:  H, for identification.

   4   A   How do you want me to spell Alice, like the Wonderland?

   5   Q   Spell it the way that you believe it should be spelled.

   6            When you first reviewed this notebook and that name,

   7   did you find it difficult to decipher the actual name?

   8   A   No, not really, although it's not a very common name, but

   9   it was very obvious.

  10   Q   I note that the -- you drew Anas with a fairly straight

  11   line across; is that right?

  12   A   That's one way to write it.

  13   Q   And you wrote Allen with a line going up.

  14            Could we put this on the --

  15            MR. SCHMIDT:  Offer this into evidence, your Honor.

  16            MR. KARAS:  No objection.

  17            THE COURT:  WEH H received.

  18            (Defendant's Exhibit WEH H received in evidence.)

  19            MR. SCHMIDT:  Can we put this on the Elmo, please?

  20   Q   Now, you drew Anas with a straight line across; is that

  21   right?

  22   A   The first --

  23   Q   Yes.

  24   A   Yes.

  25   Q   And Allen, sort of coming up?



                                                                3703



   1   A   Yes.

   2   Q   Now, in the book the word that you translated "Anas" isn't

   3   a straight line across, is it?  Do you recall?

   4   A   Could you please repeat that?

   5   Q   The word "Anas" isn't written with a straight line across

   6   the top, it's written with a line going up?

   7   A   Yes.

   8   Q   Why don't we put that on the screen also.

   9            Prior to the second time that you reviewed this book,

  10   were you asked whether that name was Anas, A-N-A-S?
