<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  11   case.  The one thing that's clear, this defendant is clearly

  12   guilty.  The evidence was overwhelming, he admitted it.  You

  13   are looking at a person who is so guilty, and what Mr. Baugh

  14   tells you is, well, if he's sent for life imprisonment think

  15   about it, sixty years times 365 days.  And I submit to you

  16   think 60 years times 365 days times three eight hour shifts

  17   for all the guards who have to guard him for those 60 years,

  18   for all the guards who are going to have to guard someone who

  19   hates America so much he kills with no remorse, for all the

  20   guards who will be viewed from his eyes as the enemy, for all

  21   the guards he thinks should die.  Sixty times 365 times 24,

  22   times 3.  You have to get through all those shifts to make

  23   sure that an innocent man, a guard, does not die.

  24            You heard reference to the fact that he wished to be

  25   a martyr.  Now I think for a moment, well, if he wanted to be




                                                                7216


   1   a martyr although he ran away, you give him what he wants or

   2   what he doesn't want.  Let me make a suggestion.  Give him no

   3   vote.  He killed 213 people.  You do justice for the crime he

   4   committed, and for the victims he killed, so mercilessly.

   5            And also remember something; we talk about the word

   6   revenge.  Mr. Baugh would like you to think that a sentence of

   7   death is revenge and let's stop the killing.  Revenge is when

   8   you kill someone else for something that someone around them

   9   did.  Retribution is legitimate.  213 people had their lives

  10   snuffed out.  All their family lives around them were ruined.

  11   The four thousand injured, included maimed, blinded, crippled

  12   people who have to deal with life.  Their lives are ruined.

  13            There are two 213 people who never lived another day

  14   after that bombing.  Mr. Al'-Owahli being sentenced to death

  15   he'll be given a sentence no worse than a sentence he imposed

  16   on 213 people without any sense of due process, without any

  17   right, without any decency.

  18            You've been told that if you vote for death you want

  19   to be a killer, and I submit to you by saying that no one

  20   wants to be a killer.  No one is asked to be a killer.  We are

  21   sitting here in a system of law that says some crimes are so

  22   horrible, some murders are so egregious, sometimes the cause

  23   is so great, the person should face the death penalty and you

  24   agreed to fairly weigh that, and if you fairly weigh that in

  25   this case with this crime committed, I submit to you that the




                                                                7217


   1   only punishment that does justice for the victims is the death

   2   penalty.  The person who is responsible for Al-'Owahli's death

   3   is Al-'Owahli.  He knew what he was doing.  He had a free

   4   choice, and he went ahead and did it, and don't let anyone put

   5   that weight on you.

   6            When you look at the mitigating factors and you see

   7   discussion of other persons more culpable or equally culpable

   8   not facing death, think about the persons who have no

   9   culpability, Nathan Algana, buried beneath the rubble and they

  10   all face death and they had no choice.  Mr. Baugh said to you

  11   you have to think at the end as to what is appropriate, and

  12   then he said, appropriate as to what?  I submit to you your

  13   verdict should be appropriate as to the law, as to justice,

  14   and to your oath, an oath you gave and you can vote for or

  15   against the death penalty.

  16            Let's be frank.  It's not easy to ask you to vote for

  17   the death penalty.  It's not easy to vote for the death

  18   penalty.  No one claims it is.  It's extremely hard.  It

  19   should be hard.  Thank God it's hard.  But sometimes in life

  20   the hard things are what you have to do.  Sometimes the hard

  21   things are difficult, but the answer is clear.  I submit to

  22   you when you go in the jury room bring in a sense of

  23   Al-'Owahli, bring in a sense of the prison guards, and bring

  24   in a sense of the victims, and when you look at al-'Owahli

  25   recognize that he's the one who put himself here.  He had a




                                                                7218


   1   free mind, he had a free will, he had a choice.  He made that

   2   choice.  He killed.  He must be held accountable.

   3            Think about the prison guards who will have to guard

   4   him for those 60 times 365 times eight, times three, and don't

   5   tell them he's small.  Don't tell Ellen Bomer he's small.

   6   Don't tell Howard Kavaler's children he's small, because if he

   7   proved anything in this case, he proved that small people

   8   kill.

   9            Think about the victims.  We submit to you the single

  10   most important factor in this case are those victims.  What

  11   they went through, their pain, their loss, and their

  12   suffering.  We won't show you any pictures, videotapes.  You

  13   know what they said.  You know what they said and you saw the

  14   pain, and Mrs. Bartley who lost a husband and a son.  The

  15   pride, the carriage of Teresia Rungu to wheel herself in here

  16   with so much dignity after what was done to her.  For the

  17   people, the hundred bodies, people who died beneath the

  18   rubble, from Mordecai Thomas Onuno who carries around that

  19   anniversary card, because that's all that he has left to hold

  20   on to.  For Clara Aliganga who has nothing to hold on to, no

  21   Nathan, because Al-'Owahli decided to steal all these people

  22   from their loved ones to kill them brutally.

  23            I submit to you when you look at the law, the law
