<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">   7   not, you are just basing that on what he said, right?

   8   A   Yes.

   9   Q   The meeting was about traveling back to Afghanistan, this

  10   first meeting.  And what Mohamed related to you about the

  11   first meeting was that at the first meeting it wasn't

  12   presented as if it was an emergency -- this is the first

  13   meeting -- but that he should plan to return to Afghanistan.

  14   A   Yes.

  15   Q   And Mohamed indicated to you that his impression of the

  16   first meeting was that this travel had more to do with

  17   religious life styles and issues of that.  This is at the

  18   first meeting.

  19   A   Right.  I believe he told, what he told me how he

  20   responded to Saleh was, well, I'll go back to Afghanistan,

  21   it's an Islamic country, and that he would go back.

  22   Q   This is at the meeting where Saleh begins to talk to

  23   Mohamed about getting the travel documents together.

  24   A   Yes.

  25   Q   The second meeting is also a meeting that is more calm,



                                                                4701



   1   but the message is still the same, prepare yourself for

   2   travel; isn't that right?

   3   A   Yes.

   4   Q   By August, Saleh's urgency about the travel has changed,

   5   isn't that correct, according to Mohamed Odeh?

   6   A   Yes.

   7   Q   He says that Saleh is now more excited, right?

   8   A   Yes.

   9   Q   He is now ordering Mohamed Odeh to get his things together

  10   to leave.

  11   A   Yes.

  12   Q   Mohamed is reluctant to leave.  He likes Kenya.  This is

  13   what he tells you.

  14   A   Yes.

  15   Q   There is an incident that takes place -- this is my last

  16   question for Saleh.  There is an incident that takes place in

  17   Mombasa where Saleh confronts Mohamed in the street, and he is

  18   having a shouting match with Mohamed.

  19   A   Yes.

  20   Q   And Mohamed relates to you that Saleh is angry with him

  21   for not moving fast enough; isn't that correct?

  22   A   Yes.

  23   Q   And he is berating him in front of Fahad.

  24   A   Yes.

  25   Q   Now I want to move to Fahad.  Mohamed tells you that he



                                                                4702



   1   doesn't like the fact that Saleh is speaking to him this way

   2   in front of Fahad; isn't that right?

   3   A   Yes.

   4   Q   Let's just go back to Fahad for a second and I think I am

   5   done.  Mohamed tells you that Fahad is a 22-year-old whose

   6   family is originally from Yemen but they are living in Kenya,

   7   correct?

   8   A   Yes.

   9   Q   He says he is not sure if Fahad is Al Qaeda.  He uses the

  10   word probably Al Qaeda.

  11   A   OK.

  12   Q   He describes Fahad as a young person in search of jihad.

  13   A   Yes.

  14   Q   And that Fahad was hot-blooded, right?

  15   A   Yes.

  16   Q   Looking for action.

  17   A   Yes.

  18   Q   In fact, I think in your notes you underlined the word

  19   action.

  20   A   OK.

  21   Q   In fact, Fahad paid $6,000 to take a course about bombing,

  22   explosives.

  23   A   Yes.

  24   Q   Paid for it out of his own pockets, right?

  25   A   Yes.



                                                                4703



   1   Q   And what Mohamed says to you, he tells you about this

   2   incident where Fahad comes to visit him and he's got some TNT

   3   and some detonators, something like that.

   4   A   Yes.
