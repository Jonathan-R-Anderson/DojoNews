  23   Everybody does.  Oh, no, you killed one of us.  We can kill

  24   one of you.  You killed ten of us.  We can kill a hundred of

  25   you.  You killed eight of us.  We can kill 200 of you.




                                                                7182


   1   Everybody has always got a good reason to kill, but it only

   2   makes more killing, period.

   3            In fact, each of you individually today is going to

   4   be asked to kill.  That's right, to kill.  Now, I will tell

   5   you this.  You will debate it amongst yourselves, as you have

   6   with every other issue.  You will discuss it.  I pray you will

   7   show respect for each other, because my client is entitled to

   8   12 individual jurors debating his life, not six real strong

   9   ones and overpowering six real quiet ones, not one real big

  10   muscle-bound person who makes everybody else do what they want

  11   to do, each person in this box.  No place else in the world is

  12   there more equality than this box.

  13            And the reason it is, is that unless each one of you

  14   vote to kill, individually, it can't happen.  The judge can't

  15   make it happen.  These gentlemen can't make it happen.  No one

  16   can.  In fact, if 11 of you -- well, only you can do that.

  17            We've not been able to offer you any direct evidence

  18   about the defendant's life.  However, you do understand some

  19   things.  One, he's deeply religious, and that is a given.

  20   Now, there are people in his own religion who disagree with

  21   his interpretation of his religion.  Well, there are people in

  22   my religion who disagree with my interpretation of my

  23   religion.  That's not a big thing.

  24            You know he's concerned with his nation.  You know

  25   he's concerned with the plight of his community.  You know




                                                                7183


   1   that because of when he was 14, he was reading this.  When

   2   he's 18, he's on his way to Afghanistan to fight and get shot

   3   at.

   4            You know that his motive for killing doesn't involve

   5   greed or amorous or any of those things.  Perhaps the

   6   attainment of paradise, but there's no lust for blood.  In

   7   fact, when the government says, well, after he was caught he

   8   said he didn't want to kill the Kenyans.  No, we know when


   9   this plan was hatched, he suggested the bomb be placed

  10   differently.

  11            And also, remember that when he threw the grenades,

  12   not one lab person came in and said they found fragmentation

  13   parts from the grenades.  There are two different types of

  14   grenades.  There are grenades with fragmentation that blows

  15   out and kills people, and then there are things that are just
