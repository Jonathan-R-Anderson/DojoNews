  22            Mr. Fitzgerald tried to be helpful in some way but it

  23   dropped between the cracks.  There is no allegation of

  24   government misconduct.  I believe that a jury could infer from

  25   that and other things and along with the political climate



                                                                6942



   1   that family members were unwilling to cooperate because of

   2   fear in a political climate, and I think we have to explain

   3   the fact that there are no family members here to set it in a

   4   more traditional --

   5            THE COURT:  How does this explain what the motivation

   6   and concerns of Mr. al-'Owahli's family is?

   7            MR. COHN:  It sets the letters in context, your

   8   Honor, because I am not prepared to breach the attorney

   9   relationship and testify that the family said that they, it

  10   was not to their advantage to come.  And I believe a juror

  11   could infer from that knowing something about the political

  12   climate appellate, that it's not made out of whole cloth that

  13   the family was afraid.  And that's all it's for.  It's not to

  14   prove that it's a repressive government.  It's for a very

  15   limited purpose.

  16            THE COURT:  You know we know that we have some

  17   extraordinarily conscientious jurors.  Several of them have

  18   postgraduate degree.  Several of them are, if not by education

  19   or occupation, persons who are extremely literate.  It's a

  20   marvelous crosssection.  I mean every time I look at them I

  21   think I compliment the lawyers who exercised their challenges.

  22   You got by ethnicity, by socioeconomic standards, by gender

  23   you have really a wonderful jury.  How long do you think it

  24   would take the slowest reader on that jury to read all of the

  25   material that you're presenting?



                                                                6943



   1            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, I mean right now we're just

   2   talking about the report.

   3            THE COURT:  That's a question that really calls for a

   4   very specific answer.

   5            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, I can tell the Court directly

   6   that if I introduce this into evidence as information I

   7   introduce it as information in my closing, I can refer to any

   8   excerpt in here to offer as explanation for why --

   9            THE COURT:  Why don't you do that in advance?  Why

  10   don't you highlight and introduce that?

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  I have an objection to substance.

  12   He already testified once to the jury about what he --

  13            THE COURT:  I know I went off on a tangent, but

  14   that's particularly thinking of the 250 page book.

  15            MR. COHN:  The Amnesty International has a very

  16   limited function and one of them is just --

  17            THE COURT:  You are not offering the letters?
