  24   looks like a walk-in closet -- I think the number is 138 --

  25   that comes off that lateral hallway.  It is a visitation booth




                                                                8170


   1   that a visitor can go into.  The inmate would come out of his

   2   cell, the slider would open through to that area, sit down at

   3   the stool and also have access to visitation there, where the

   4   visitor is sealed in, locked into that walk-in closet, and the

   5   inmate is on the other side.  This reduces the demand for the

   6   staff to have to handle the inmate quite as much as they would

   7   even on the control unit, because you could just open the

   8   doors to have the inmate move from place to place.  Some staff

   9   would be involved but this much reduces that, if they

  10   determine to place someone in this kind of setting.

  11   Q.  What you are describing then is within the control unit,

  12   which is more secure than the administrative maximum unit or

  13   even cells within the control unit that are more secure than

  14   the general control unit, is that it?

  15   A.  I am not sure this is geographically located in the

  16   control unit per se, but these cells represent a higher degree

  17   of security and reduced inmate contact than in the control

  18   unit.

  19   Q.  Are you aware within the Bureau of Prisons system of

  20   inmates who have been locked down under control unit

  21   conditions for a substantial number of years?

  22   A.  Yes, I am.

  23   Q.  Are you familiar with an inmate named Thomas Silverstein

  24   and an inmate named Clayton Fountain?  When I say familiar, I

  25   don't mean do you know them.  Are you familiar with their




                                                                8171


   1   cases and their situations?

   2   A.  Yes, I am.

   3   Q.  Did each of these inmates murder a correctional officer on

   4   the same day in 1983 at the facility in Marion, Illinois?

   5   A.  Yes, sir, tragically, two separate incidents to correction

   6   officers that were killed on the same day.

   7   Q.  For the past 18 years, what conditions of confinement --

   8   first of all, do you know where each inmate is presently

   9   located and housed?

  10   A.  Clayton Fountain is in a special cell unit at Springfield.

  11   Silverstein, as I recall, is in a special cell unit at

  12   Leavenworth.

  13   Q.  Without detailing at great length their conditions of

  14   confinement, can you just generally sketch for the jury what

  15   kind of conditions of confinement have these two men lived in

  16   separately for the last 18 years?

  17   A.  They are in extraordinarily secure confinement.  They are

  18   in a single cell.  My understanding is that there is an

  19   adjacent cell that has had the fixtures removed for an

  20   exercise area, with the slider in between.  Any sort of --

  21   there is very limited staff contact.  They are continuously

  22   monitored by closed circuit television and microphones,

  23   including see-in-the-dark kind of equipment.  So they are

  24   continuously monitored.  Any movement is with extraordinary

  25   security, closed staffing, closed off doors, very intense




                                                                8172


   1   supervision and restriction.

   2   Q.  We have been talking about Florence and the super max

   3   facility.  How many United States penitentiaries are there

   4   meeting the highest level of security around the United

   5   States, to your knowledge?

   6   A.  There are nine.  There are eight that are standard US

   7   penitentiaries.  Then there is Marion, which functions at a

   8   level kind of midway between a regular US penitentiary and ADX

   9   Florence.  So if you include Marion, there are nine plus ADX.

  10   Q.  To your knowledge, do all these units have something

  11   called a special housing unit, i.e., a high security winning

  12   or set of cells within what is already a high security prison?

  13   A.  Yes, sir.

  14   Q.  Does the administration of those institutions, no matter

  15   who the prison is, have available to it very high security

  16   measures even within something that is not super max?

  17   A.  Yes, they do.

  18   Q.  Have you reviewed a videotape that I played for you?

  19   A.  Yes, I have.
