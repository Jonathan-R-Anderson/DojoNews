   9   jury home.  The juror said that she had every hope that she

  10   would be able to attend tomorrow.

  11            There was no alternative.  You weren't here.  In any

  12   event, I didn't think there would be an objection to excusing

  13   the jury.  It was clear that the juror could not continue.

  14   There is every hope that she'll be able to come to court

  15   tomorrow.  But we're adjourned for the day insofar as the jury

  16   is concerned, and in about ten minutes I'll resume in the

  17   robing room with counsel.

  18            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, considering the balance of

  19   what we have to consider in the robing room you might want to

  20   inquire whether the clients wish to go back?

  21            THE COURT:  Why don't you inquire of your clients.

  22            MR. COHN:  Yes.  Mr. Al-'Owhali would like to return.

  23            THE COURT:  If all of the defendants wish to return.

  24            MR. BAUGH:  Mr. Odeh would like to go back to the

  25   MCC.

   1            MR. STERN:  Khalfan Mohamed would like to return.

   1            (Pages 6492 through 6528 sealed)

   2            (In open court; jury not present)

   3            THE COURT:  Have the parties now had an opportunity

   4   to review the preliminary instructions?

   5            MR. GARCIA:  Yes, your Honor.

   6            THE COURT:  I suppose one question which we should at

   7   least articulate is the appropriateness of any preliminary

   8   instructions at all.  In McVeigh I think there weren't any.

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  In McVeigh we had given your Honor

  10   the preliminary instructions from McVeigh.

  11            THE COURT:  Wasn't it just two or three paragraphs?

  12            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

  13            THE COURT:  It was very short.  It was certainly not

  14   as detailed as this.  I'm inclined to favor having preliminary

  15   instructions simply because this process is not something that

  16   would be commonly known by a jury.  Does anybody think we

  17   should not have preliminary instructions?

  18            MR. RUHNKE:  No, your Honor.

  19            MR. BAUGH:  No, your Honor.

  20            MR. RUHNKE:  I think, your Honor, there are things

  21   about the penalty phase in the federal death penalty case that

  22   are just not within anyone's average knowledge.  I think a

  23   jury needs to have a preview of what's coming.

  24            THE COURT:  As a result of our conference thus far,

  25   we've left unresolved the standards for determining the




                                                                6530


   1   weighing of the factors.  We've left unresolved what the

   2   Eighth Circuit would call the mercy instruction, that is, the

   3   instruction to the jury that regardless of their weighing of

   4   the factors they need not find the death penalty.

   5            We've left unresolved what, if anything, the Court

   6   would say in the final instructions with respect to

   7   deterrence.  And we've left unresolved whether there must be

   8   unanimity as to the gateway aggravators not being applicable.

   9   Those four items.

  10            MR. RUHNKE:  I'm sorry.  You dropped your voice at

  11   the end of the last.

  12            THE COURT:  The unanimity as to if the jury finds
