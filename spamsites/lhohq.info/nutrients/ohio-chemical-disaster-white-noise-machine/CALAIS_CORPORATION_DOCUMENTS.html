  15   to travel soon; is that right?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  And Mr. Odeh related to you over these interviews that he

  18   was told that he assumed that the travel would include his

  19   wife and his child, right?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  Mr. Odeh further told you that he informed Mustafa that he

  22   would work on getting his documents together legitimately so

  23   that he and his family could travel; isn't that correct?

  24   A.  I am not sure about that.  He wanted to go with his

  25   family, that's for sure, but I don't know about -- yes, he did

   1   say that he would try to get more than one passport if that

   2   meant his family, fine.  But then they said no, you get one

   3   passport for yourself.

   4   Q.  That's right.

   5            THE COURT:  Who said you get one passport?

   6            THE WITNESS:  Saleh.

   7   Q.  Ultimately Saleh told him that.

   8   A.  Saleh.

   9   Q.  And Saleh told him that a little further down the line

  10   when Saleh was a little anxious about the delay that Mohamed

  11   was having in getting his passport through regular channels,

  12   right?

  13   A.  I didn't get the last part.

  14   Q.  I will rephrase it.  The statement that Saleh made to

  15   Mohamed, which was to just get one passport, and even if it

  16   has to be fake get a passport and be ready to go, this

  17   statement was made a little further down the line; isn't that

  18   right?

  19   A.  Yes.  I don't know if Saleh said that.  I recall that as

  20   maybe being from --

  21   Q.  Mustafa?

  22   A.  Mustafa saying, but on the orders of Saleh.

  23   Q.  This was after there was some delay on behalf of Mohamed

  24   to get his paperwork together through regular channels; isn't

  25   that right?  Isn't that correct?

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Mr. Odeh had indicated to you that in the six years that

   3   he had been in Al Qaeda, he had never had that kind of

   4   pressure put on him before to move so urgently; isn't that

   5   right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  He also indicated to you that he really had a willingness

   8   to stay in Kenya, that he liked Kenya and he wanted to stay

   9   there.

  10   A.  Yes, he did indicate that.

  11   Q.  What Mr. Odeh has indicated to you is that around the time

  12   he had this conversation with Mustafa he was living in Witu,

  13   right?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  And Witu is an area that is the sub -- it's a rural area

  16   in Kenya, isn't that correct?

  17   A.  I don't know.

  18            MR. RICCO:  Your Honor, I think this map has been

  19   previously identified of the Kenya area.

  20            I am sorry, Judge.  I am informed by Mr. Wilford that

  21   it was Odeh C but they couldn't get it up yesterday.  So with

  22   the permission of the court it is being displayed to the jury.

  23   I am sorry.  We would like this map marked as Odeh C.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  No objection.

  25            THE COURT:  You are offering it?

  10   A.  No.

  11   Q.  What Mr. Odeh indicated to you, that he happened to be in

  12   Mombasa on business and he ran into Saleh, and Saleh told him

  13   to come to the town of Malindi for a meeting; isn't that

  14   right?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  And Mr. Odeh indicated to you that he came to the meeting,

  17   and at the meeting there were other members of Al Qaeda, and

  18   at that meeting Saleh stated to the group that he had recently

  19   returned from Afghanistan and that Bin Laden was calling all

  20   Mujahedeen to return to Afghanistan, correct?

  21   A.  Mujahedeen and Al Qaeda members.

  22   Q.  Mr. Odeh indicated to you that afterwards he spoke to

  23   Saleh alone and said that he would relocate to Afghanistan

  24   because it was an Islamic country and it would be his duty --

  25   he used the word duty -- to return to Afghanistan, correct?
