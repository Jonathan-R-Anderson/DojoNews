   4            THE COURT:  Neither do I.  Please be seated.

   5            Thank you.

   6            (Jury present)

   7            THE COURT:  Good morning.  Mr. Fitzgerald.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge, good morning.  The

   9   government formally offers but does not read at this time

  10   corrected pages to the Stipulation 1, Government Exhibit 162R,

  11   163R, and a corrected stipulation 154R, and we also offer but

  12   do not read at this time Government Exhibit 7, which is a

  13   chart of all the stipulations offered by the government in

  14   this case.

  15            THE COURT:  Received.

  16            (Government Exhibits 7, 154R, 162R and 163R received

  17   in evidence)

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  And we also offer at this time

  19   Government Exhibit 193, which is a stipulation between the

  20   government and Odeh and his counsel, and I would like to read

  21   that.

  22            THE COURT:  Yes.

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  It is hereby stipulated and agreed

  24   by and between the United States of America and defendant

  25   Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, by and with the consent of his



                                                                5219



   1   undersigned attorneys, as follows:

   2            If recalled to testify as a witness, Kelly Mount

   3   would testify that on or about March 17, 1999, she vacuumed

   4   Government Exhibit 529, the Nike bag, and each of its contents

   5   other than those items about which she testified previously,

   6   namely, Government Exhibits 535A, through 535E and 535G

   7   through 535I, obtaining a single filter sample.  She then

   8   analyzed that sample, which analysis proved negative for the

   9   presence of explosives residue in that sample.

  10            It is further stipulated and agreed that this

  11   stipulation may be received in evidence as a government

  12   exhibit at trial.

  13            THE COURT:  Received.

  14            (Government Exhibit 193 received in evidence)

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  With that your Honor, the government

  16   rests its rebuttal case.

  17            THE COURT:  Government rests.  So the record is

  18   complete, ladies and gentlemen.  All of the evidence is now

  19   before you and we proceed to the closing arguments.  One of my

  20   functions with respect to closing arguments is I am the

  21   timekeeper, and we'll proceed now with the government's

  22   closing argument.

  23            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, counsel, ladies and

  24   gentlemen, good morning.

  25            You may recall that my partner, Mr. Butler, began his



                                                                5220



   1   opening statement by setting the scene for you in the

   2   midmorning hours of August 7, 1998, just minutes before two

   3   bombs ripped through our embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar

   4   es Salaam, Tanzania.  I would like to begin my closing

   5   statements by showing you what the scene was like in the

   6   immediate aftermath of those bombings to remind all of us

   7   about why we are here.

   8            (Video played)

   9            MR. KARAS:  Ladies and gentlemen, those portions of

  10   those videos serve as a painful symbol, painful reminder of

  11   why it is that we have spent the last two and a half months

  12   together, spending the last two and a half months to review

  13   evidence that was collected from all over the world.

  14            And the reason that we have done this is because we

  15   have been involved in a search for justice, a search to

  16   determine who it is that committed these acts, these

  17   unspeakable acts that ended the lives and the hopes and the

  18   dreams of hundreds of people, these vicious acts that

  19   shattered three friendly nations, these evil acts defined no

  20   justification, these unjust acts that demand accountability.

  21            Now this search for justice began by Mr. Butler

  22   committing to you that the government would establish beyond a

  23   reasonable doubt that the defendant Mohamed Odeh and the

  24   defendant Mohamed Al-'Owhali participated in the bombing of

  25   the American Embassy in Nairobi on August 7th and that Khalfan



                                                                5221



   1   Khamis Mohamed participated in the bombing of the embassy in

   2   Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  And I submit to you, ladies and

   3   gentlemen, we have honored that commitment and we have

   4   established the guilt of those defendants for those crimes in

   5   this case.

   6            But we committed to more.  We committed to showing to

   7   you that there was a conspiracy behind these embassy attacks,

   8   a conspiracy to murder the people of the United States simply

   9   because they were American, and we committed to showing to you

  10   that all four of these defendants participated in that

  11   conspiracy.  And I submit to you that we have honored that

  12   commitment, that we have established beyond a reasonable doubt

  13   the guilt of all four of those defendants in connection with

  14   the conspiracy.

  15            Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the

  16   close of the case and all of the evidence has been put before
