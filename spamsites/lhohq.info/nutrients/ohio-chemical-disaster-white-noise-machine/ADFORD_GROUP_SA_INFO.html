  14   Q.  You talked about some things here and some things there?

  15   A.  That's correct.

  16   Q.  Now, one of the first things that you talked with him

  17   about was the experience he had in Afghanistan, right?

  18   A.  I'm trying to think when we first broached that subject.

  19   Q.  It's not even that important when it was.  That is a thing

  20   you talked to him about?

  21   A.  Yes, sir.

  22   Q.  And you knew that he went there around 1994 or 1995,

  23   right?

  24   A.  That's what he told me, yes.

  25   Q.  Well, did you have anything to tell you that that wasn't

                            Perkins - cross/Stern

   1   true?

   2   A.  I didn't have anything that necessarily contradicted what

   3   he was telling me.

   4   Q.  Yes.  As a matter of fact, you knew from speaking to

   5   Mr. Hamisi, the fruit juice or juice cafâ€š guy, that that's

   6   what he had told him, too, that he went to Afghanistan around

   7   that time, right?

   8   A.  I can't remember specifically what Mr. Hamisi said in

   9   terms of the time frame.  It may have been a broad time frame

  10   that he spoke of.

  11   Q.  Okay.  And when you talked about Afghanistan I want to

  12   make sure I understand, you're saying that he told you went

  13   there to help other Muslims, right?

  14   A.  He went to Afghanistan to train.

  15   Q.  But did he tell you that he was going because he wanted to

  16   help other Muslims?

  17   A.  That he would use that to help other Muslims if necessary

  18   through armed struggle is what he said, yes.

  19   Q.  But did he tell that you one of the reasons he went was

  20   because he wanted to help other Muslims?

  21   A.  Yes, he did.

  22   Q.  And when you were talking about this he talked about the

  23   way Muslims were under attack in Bosnia and Chechyna, right?

  24   A.  He did.

  25   Q.  He told you, right, to fight to help his Muslim brothers,

                            Perkins - cross/Stern

   1   didn't he?

   2   A.  Yes, he did.

   3   Q.  When he was talking about that he was talking about

   4   fighting in a war defending Muslims, wasn't he?

   5   A.  Yes, he was.
