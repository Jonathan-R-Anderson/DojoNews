   7   A   B.  The system of the netaq to serve no 2.  The netaq is

   8   term used in the security system.  For example:  An embassy of

   9   a foreign country will have several netaq.  The first netaq

  10   will be inside the fence and the security from this foreign

  11   country will take care of it.  The second netaq is the police

  12   outside the gate.  The third netaq might be a patrol car

  13   stationed about two blocks from the embassy.  The fourth netaq

  14   might be a police unit responsible to protect some sensitive

  15   targets in that area, about 2 kilometers away.  The system of

  16   the netaq and the important part of the town to serve No. 3.

  18            Before we discuss those entries, Agent Ernst, could

  20   reflected on 354A?

  21   A   It is tahary.

  23   screen.

                                                                3014

   6   Q   If we could have Government's Exhibit 355H2, and if we

   7   could zoom in on entry 22 -- no, in the middle of the page

   8   under examples.  And could you read that for us.

   9   A   Example, how the four groups works together.

  11   the other group, even Majmou3at.  Al-qeyada does not know how

  18   what date does that list this file being created?

  19   A   Saturday, May 30, 1998.

  20   Q   Agent, I would like to put the computer printouts aside

  21   now and turn to the other exhibits that are in front of you

  22   and I would like to start with Government's Exhibit 361, which

  23   I believe is the Egyptian passport.  Could you tell us, that

  24   passport, was that photographed inside the residence as you

  25   described it earlier?



                                                                3015



   1   A   Yes, it was.

   2   Q   Nationality?

   3   A   Egyptian.

   4   Q   And the name on that passport, if you could read it for

   5   us?

   6   A   Ahmed, A-H-M-E-D, Bahaa, B-A-H-A-A, Eldin, E-L-D-I-N,

   7   Mohamed, M-O-H-A-M-E-D, Adam, A-D-A-M.

   8   Q   Thank you.  If we could put that aside and go to

   9   Government's Exhibit 357.  Could you just tell the jury

  10   generally what is that item 357?

  11   A   This is a photograph of a telephone address book that we

  12   found during the search.

  13   Q   If we could display the last page of that address book on

  14   the screen.  If we could zoom in on the written entry.  Agent,

  15   are you able to read that off the screen for us?

  16   A   Yes.

  17   Q   Would you.

  18   A   Well, it is some type of writing or symbol number.  Fax

  19   254-2-820067.

  20   Q   Agent, do you have in front of you the corresponding

  21   translation in 357T, which I believe is in the other pile?

  22   A   Yes, I do.

  23   Q   Could you turn to the corresponding translation page for

  24   that entry, and if it is possible if we could have that also

  25   on the screen, the translation 357-T final page.  If we could



                                                                3016



   1   do it at the same time that would be better.  Agent, if you

   2   would just read for us the corresponding entry from

   3   Government's Exhibit 357-T for the page that we have

   4   displayed.

   5   A   Yes.  Wadieh, W-A-D-I-E-H.

   6   Q   And now if we could go to Government's Exhibit 359.

   7   Again, is that a document that you photographed in the search

   8   you described for us?

   9   A   Yes, it is.

  10   Q   If we could have Government's Exhibit 359T displayed.

  11   Could you read that for us, Agent.

  12   A   Details of the accident in which Galal died.

  13            This is the third big accident in Tanzania after the

  14   seventies train accident, but this time it was very painful as

  15   the accident was on Lake Victoria.  This is the second ship

  16   accident and the first was on the Zanzibar Sea where the two

  17   ships collided on 29 June 1990.

  18   Q   If we could display the rest of that document page and if

  19   you could read the entire document beginning with the

  20   accident.

  21   A   The accident began with the departure of a passenger ship

  22   working between -- the spelling on the word is M-W-A-N-Z-A

  23   (Arabic) and B-U-K-O-B-A (Arabic) a long time during the night
