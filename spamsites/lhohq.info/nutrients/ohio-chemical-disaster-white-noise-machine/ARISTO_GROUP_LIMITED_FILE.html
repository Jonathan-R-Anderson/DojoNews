  22   notice, that's fine.

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  I don't know what inference counsel

  24   is attaching to an assurance not to amend the notice.  We gave

  25   a notice.  Your Honor changed it.




                                                                6443


   1            THE COURT:  I certainly envisioned that there was

   2   going to be another document which said amended notice, and

   3   which combined surviving victims with the deceased victims and

   4   which made some other changes.  Now it is really a matter of

   5   what is most convenient.  Obviously, the rulings that I have

   6   made that are embodied in my January opinion are in full

   7   enforcement.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  Can we make one suggestion?  Nothing

   9   substantive is changing from the notice other than our

  10   dropping the one factor we just told you about and complying

  11   with your Honor's decision, so creating a new notice is form

  12   over substance, which I think we should do.  Once we have the

  13   verdict in it may make more sense to do that.

  14            THE COURT:  All right.

  15            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor.

  16            THE COURT:  So in light of that last comment where we

  17   are is that the death notice consists of the original notice

  18   filed by the government, to be modified as indicated in the

  19   Court's opinion of January, to be further modified by the

  20   government's dropping of simultaneous notice of two bombings,

  21   and whatever further rulings the Court may make after a

  22   verdict.  We all have all of that.  Mr. Fitzgerald says it's

  23   form over substance.  It might be a useful form to have, but

  24   it has no additional legal consequence.

  25            MR. BAUGH:  With that assurance, your Honor, we have




                                                                6444


   1   no problem, and we still have an issue for tomorrow.
