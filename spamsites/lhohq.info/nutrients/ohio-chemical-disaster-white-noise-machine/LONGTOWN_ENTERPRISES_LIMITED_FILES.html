   6            THE COURT:  The government contends.

   7            MR. COHN:  Well, then it should be reflected with our

   8   contention that it was rebutted.

   9            THE COURT:  I wonder whether, you know, the suggested

  10   language was that the defendant has introduced the SAM and

  11   whether that's --

  12            MR. COHN:  I'm justing looking, the government's

  13   contention, if you are putting contentions --

  14            THE COURT:  As to the second non-statutory --

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  First.

  16            THE COURT:  As to the -- yes, as to the first

  17   non-statutory aggravating factor, the government contends that

  18   Al-'Owhali poses a continuing and serious threat even though

  19   he will be imprisoned for life.  Al-'Owhali contends that he

  20   will be subject to rigorous security (the special

  21   administrative measures), and will, therefore, not constitute

  22   a threat.  The government contends that, despite these

  23   measures, the threat will be present.  It is for you to decide

  24   whether the defendant would or would not pose a continuing and

  25   serious threat.



                                                                7290



   1            The special administrative measures are not

   2   automatically applied, but are applied in accordance with

   3   their provisions.

   4            Is there an exhibit number?  Should I have that?

   5            MR. COHN:  It's Defense Al-'Owhali --

   6            THE COURT:  Is that an exhibit they have asked for?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  No, Judge.

   8            MR. BAUGH:  They have not asked for the exhibit.

   9            MR. COHN:  They haven't asked for that exhibit.

  10            THE COURT:  Let me read this again:  As to the first

  11   non-statutory aggravating factor, the government contends that

  12   Al-'Owhali poses a continuing and serious threat even though

  13   he will be imprisoned for life.  Al-'Owhali contends that he

  14   will be subject to rigorous security (the special

  15   administrative measures), and will, therefore, not constitute

  16   a threat.  The government contends that, despite these

  17   measures, the threat will be present.  It is for you to decide

  18   whether the defendant would or would not pose a continuing and

  19   serious threat.

  20            The special administrative measures are not

  21   automatically applied, but are applied in accordance with

  22   their provisions.

  23            MR. COHN:  If your Honor please, which have been

  24   submitted as Al-'Owhali Exhibit R.

  25            THE COURT:  Al-'Owhali Exhibit R.



                                                                7291



   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I believe it is R.  If

   2   we're going to reference the Al-'Owhali exhibit, which is a

   3   regulation, I think we should also reference the stipulation

   4   concerning the government's response to that regulation, which

   5   is 2281.

   6            THE COURT:  Why don't I say Al-'Owhali Exhibit R and

   7   stipulation --

   8            What's the number?

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  2281.

  10            THE COURT:  -- 2281 deal with these issues.

  11            Let me read it again:  As to the first non-statutory

  12   aggravating factor, the government contends that Al-'Owhali

  13   poses a continuing and serious threat even though he will be

  14   imprisoned for life.  Al-'Owhali denies that he constitutes

  15   such a threat and contends that he will be subject to rigorous

  16   security (the special administrative measures), and will,

  17   therefore, not constitute a threat.

  18            No, that's redundant.

  19            The government contends that, despite these measures,

  20   the threat will be present.  It is for you to decide whether

  21   defendant Al-'Owhali would or would not pose a continuing and

  22   serious threat.

  23            The special administrative measures are not

  24   automatically applied, but are applied in accordance with

  25   their provisions.  Al-'Owhali Exhibit R and Stipulation 2281



                                                                7292



   1   deal with these issues.

   2            Is that acceptable?

   3            MR. COHN:  Yes.

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

   5            THE COURT:  All right.  I will put that in legible

   6   form and we'll send it in to the jury.

   7            This has let us know exactly where they are in the

   8   Special Verdict Form.
