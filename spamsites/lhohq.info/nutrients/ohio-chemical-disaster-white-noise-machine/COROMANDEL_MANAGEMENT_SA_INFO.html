  20   obligations.

  21            MR. BAUGH:  Yes, sir.

  22            THE COURT:  An obligation not to impose on reasonably

  23   high-level governmental officials the burden of complying with

  24   a subpoena in this detail, most of which, it seems to me, is

  25   unnecessary for the purposes of the argument you are

   1   considering making.

   2            MR. BAUGH:  Thank you, your Honor.

   3            THE COURT:  Okay.

   4            MR. BAUGH:  I would --

   5            THE COURT:  Will you do that?

   6            MR. BAUGH:  Yes, sir.  Reserving my objection, of

   7   course.  Yes, sir, I will.

   8            THE COURT:  And when will you have that to me?

   9            MR. BAUGH:  I can't do it tomorrow.  My secretary

  10   lost her grandmother, but I will it by Tuesday.

  11            THE COURT:  All right.  I will sign the subpoenas

  12   directed to the photographic department of the -- I don't know

  13   what.  The subpoena directed to Ms. Kelly?  I'm not familiar

  14   with the name.

  15            MR. BAUGH:  It's an organization in Chicago called

  16   Voices of the Wilderness.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, just for the record, I

  18   recognize there were subpoenas which we were not provided

  19   copies of and there are some that we were.  Whatever the

  20   photographic department is, we were not given a copy of that,

  21   just so the record is clear.

  22            MR. BAUGH:  Oh, yes, that's true.

  23            THE COURT:  That's true?

  24            MR. BAUGH:  That's true.

  25            THE COURT:  I think you were given copies only of the

   1   subpoenas to governmental entities.

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, the Department of Defense,

   3   former Secretary of State and the Bureau of Prisons were the

   4   subpoenas we received.  And I understand the Bureau of Prisons

   5   is reviewing the subpoenas to get back to us, as they said in

   6   the letter.

   7            THE COURT:  All right.

   8            MR. COHN:  That's mine, your Honor.  The government

   9   has no objection to it.

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  That's correct, Judge.  That's an

  11   update of an old subpoena for Mr. Al-'Owhali's prison records.

  12            THE COURT:  I am not signing the subpoenas directed

  13   to present or ex government officials.  That includes

  14   Madeleine Albright.

  15            On another topic.

  16            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, can my client be excused at

  17   this time?  I have a lot of work to do on these subpoenas.

  18            THE COURT:  I think we're almost finished.  It

  19   depends on Mr. Submit.

  20            Mr. Schmidt, we had some colloquy on Tuesday when

  21   talking about a timetable and you said it was all subject to

  22   the status of discovery requests that you had made which had

  23   not been complied with, and I said I don't want to make any

  24   statements or commitments to the jury with respect to

  25   timetable and then discover that there was going to be an

   1   application for a continuance and that I was available, and

   2   what is the story?

   3            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, we had further discussions

   4   with the government yesterday.  As to some of the material

   5   concerning statements made by others, whether exculpatory or
