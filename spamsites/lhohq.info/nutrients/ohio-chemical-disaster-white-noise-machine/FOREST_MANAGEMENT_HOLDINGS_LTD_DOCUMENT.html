  24   Q.  And that they needed Mohamed Odeh and others to export him

  25   to Afghanistan.

                                                                1716

   1   A.  Not and the others.  I think it was more like either you,

   2   Mustafa or Ahmed the Egyptian would --

   3   Q.  Like one or two or three of them, right?

   4   A.  I don't know.  It could have been one, it could have been

   5   three.  The way I understood it to be was one of the three.

   6   Q.  But the bottom line is that what Mr. Odeh related to you

   7   was that a person came to him with a story as to why he had to

   8   go to Afghanistan, and one part of the story was that there

   9   was some sheik that needed to go.

  10   A.  The meeting with Ahmed 40 days before he had to go, that's

  11   the first time that he is hearing that this is regarding a

  12   sheik.  But before that, they are telling -- you know, the

  13   first two meetings is everybody is leaving.  So I don't

  14   understand how he would think that was just to escort one

  15   person to Afghanistan.

  16   Q.  Needless to say as to what he thought, what he told you

  17   was that Ahmed the Egyptian came to him and said the sheik

  18   needed to be escorted to Afghanistan.

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  That's what he related to you.

  21   A.  Right.

  22   Q.  They also discussed the fatwah and Mr. Odeh again stated

  23   that he was anxious about traveling on such a short notice;

  24   isn't that right?

  25   A.  On the 40-day meeting?


                  SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS (212) 805-0300
                                                                1717
       12skbin3
                               Anticev - cross

   1   Q.  Yes.

   2   A.  Well, he was anxious about traveling in general.

   3   Q.  OK.  Mr. Odeh related to you that Ahmed informed him to

   4   travel as soon as possible, even if it meant getting fake

   5   documents; isn't that correct?

   6   A.  That's what he said.

   7   Q.  And Ahmed left Mr. Odeh remain in Witu for approximately

   8   another 20 days or so, and then on July 14, 1998, he headed

   9   for Mombasa.

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  When Mr. Odeh arrives in Mombasa, he said he ran into

  12   Saleh in old Mombasa, and he asked Saleh if they still needed

  13   him to travel to Afghanistan.

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  Mr. Odeh was told yes, they still needed him to travel,

  16   but Mr. Odeh indicated that he had not received a renewal of

  17   his passport, and he did not have the necessary travel

  18   documents.  This was in July of 1998, correct?

  19   A.  Yes.
