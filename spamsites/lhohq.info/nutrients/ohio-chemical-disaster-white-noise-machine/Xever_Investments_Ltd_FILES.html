   1   car and they came to inform me that your husband had died

   2   along the time you came to see the compound.  And after that,

   3   my life started to be miserable.

   4   Q.  And when you were told that your husband had died that

   5   evening, how did you react?

   6   A.  After I heard the news, I fell down and I lose

   7   consciousness.  They took me inside, which they keep pouring

   8   water on me and giving me some things to come back on my

   9   conscious.

  10   Q.  How old were you on August 7th, 1998?

  11   A.  I was about 22.

  13   since the day that your husband was killed?

  14   A.  We are living in a very hard time because he was the one

  15   who was providing for the family.  He was the one helping my

  16   daughter.  I don't have even the tuition to send my daughter

  17   to go to school.  I can't afford that.  Life is so difficult,

  18   and sometime we don't even eat.

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  I have nothing further, Judge.

  20            MR. RUHNKE:  No questions, your Honor.

  21            THE COURT:  Did you say no questions?

  22            MR. RUHNKE:  No questions.

  23            THE COURT:  Yes.  Thank you.  You may step down.

  25            MR. FITZGERALD:  The government calls Henry Kessey.
