  25   not think for me to write that on an injury statement because




                                                                7796


   1   the heading of the form itself says it is an injury assessment

   2   form.

   3   Q.  So is the answer to the question you did not write "I gave

   4   them a good fight" yes or no?

   5   A.  That.

   6   Q.  You did not write that?

   7   A.  I did not write on that form.

   8   Q.  Well, is there another form you wrote that on?

   9   A.  No, sir.

  10   Q.  Did you make any note of that at the time it was said?

  11   A.  It was around the time when he was on the gurney and we

  12   were trying to start an IV on him.

  13   Q.  So when I ask if you made any note of that at the time it

  14   was said, would the answer be yes or no?

  15   A.  If you ask me did I write it down somewhere, no, sir, I

  16   did not write it down.

  17   Q.  About well over a month later, on December 13, an FBI

  18   agent came to talk to you, didn't he?

  19   A.  Yes, sir.

  20   Q.  That was an agent named Peter Cohn?

  21   A.  I don't remember his name at this time, but, yes, an agent

  22   came to talk with me, yes.

  23   Q.  And you remember taking notes -- not you, but an agent

  24   taking notes while he was speaking with you?

  25   A.  Yes, sir.




                                                                7797


   1   Q.  And did you ever get a chance to read those notes?

   2   A.  No, sir.

   3   Q.  That day, December 13th, you said, "I gave them a good

   4   fight," right?

   5            THE COURT:  You said that Pepe said?

   6            MR. STERN:  Correct.

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  And as far as you know, that was the first time that

   9   statement was ever written down anywhere, right?

  10   A.  Yes, sir.

  11   Q.  I want you to look at the report we were talking about

  12   earlier, K.K.M. 8.  You have it up there, right?  And see if

  13   you can, from looking at that report, tell me what injuries

  14   Mamdouh Salim had?

  15   A.  This is on Salim Mohamed.

  16   Q.  Okay.  Whoever is in that report, try and tell me what

  17   injuries that person had.

  18   A.  I don't know.  This is written by somebody else and he

  19   examined somebody else.

  20   Q.  I'm only asking you what that reflects.  I'm not asking

  21   you whether it's true or not, but what injuries that report

  22   reflects.  I know you weren't there and didn't see this

  23   individual.  I'm asking you what is reported in that document.
