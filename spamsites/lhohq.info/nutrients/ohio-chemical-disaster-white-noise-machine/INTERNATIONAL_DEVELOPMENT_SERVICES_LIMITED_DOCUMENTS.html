<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  13   would be reflected in the Lewisburg statistics, yes.

  14   Q.  And there would be a zero in the Florence ADX statistics,

  15   correct?

  16   A.  Until there was a definite tie to that individual or he

  17   were convicted either of a disciplinary offense involving that

  18   or in a court of law.

  19   Q.  But the homicide was committed in Lewisburg, correct?

  20   A.  That's my understanding.

  21   Q.  And you are aware that prisoners have sent messages out by

  22   writing with lemon juice on notes where they can be read later

  23   by another prisoner; have you heard that in your study of the

  24   prisons?

  25   A.  I don't think that I have.




                                                                8227


   1   Q.  Have you heard of inmates talking through the toilets in

   2   the plumbing systems to each other on the next floor?

   3   A.  Yes, I have.

   4   Q.  And you have heard of inmates using codes to communicate

   5   with each other?

   6   A.  Yes, I have.

   7   Q.  Have you heard of one of the codes being someone sending a

   8   message that someone had a boy that weighed eight pounds,

   9   seven ounces, and then the message was one boy, eight pounds,

  10   seven ounces means one, eight, seven, which is the California

  11   penal code designation for homicide, which was an order to

  12   kill?

  13   A.  I'm not familiar with the specifics of what codes may have

  14   been used at different times.

  15   Q.  So if codes were passed and people were killed and not

  16   detected, they would not appear in those statistics, correct?

  17   A.  That's correct.

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  If I could have one moment, your

  19   Honor, your Honor.

  20            Actually, if we could break to queue up an exhibit.

  21            THE COURT:  We can break at this point.
