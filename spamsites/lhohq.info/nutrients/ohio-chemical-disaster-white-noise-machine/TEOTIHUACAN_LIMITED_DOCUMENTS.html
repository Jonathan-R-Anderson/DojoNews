  24            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, it is a letter --

  25            THE COURT:  Let me see it.



                                                                4205



   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  I will state the objection in two

   2   words:  Self-serving hearsay.

   3            THE COURT:  This is a letter dated July 16, 1997.

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  The part where he says I am engaged

   5   in relief work.  The witness has been testifying, telling the

   6   type of work he is doing.

   7            THE COURT:  How does that distinguish this letter

   8   from the past day and a half we have had?

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  I think they were all objectionable

  10   as well.

  11            THE COURT:  Consistency -- overruled.

  12            Who is your next witness, Mr. Schmidt?

  13            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, we will be calling Ashif

  14   Juma for a very brief single purpose which I have discussed

  15   with the government, which has to do with a government exhibit

  16   that came in after his testimony for the government, and then

  17   Sikander Juma, another witness who has to be produced by the

  18   government, who I understand will be available tomorrow.

  19            THE COURT:  Are there any exhibits which are going to

  20   be introduced which have not been identified to the

  21   government?

  22            MR. DRATEL:  Yes, there may be, your Honor.

  23            THE COURT:  I said at the start of the trial that if

  24   that occurred I would sustain an objection just for that very

  25   reason.  I have obviously not enforced that rule for the past



                                                                4206



   1   two days because I realize there has been a delay getting the

   2   documents and so on.  But I will enforce it from here on.

   3            MR. DRATEL:  So the court is aware, these are

   4   documents that were received from the government.

   5            THE COURT:  You have received hundreds of thousands

   6   of documents from the government.  Identify the night before

   7   what exhibits so that we don't have this business going on of

   8   a conference between questions.  You lose continuity, it

   9   distracts the jury, it wastes time.

  10            MR. DRATEL:  I agree, your Honor.  We will notify the

  11   government this afternoon and we will designate.  One exhibit

  12   that we will be showing is already in evidence, so that is not

  13   an issue.

  14            THE COURT:  How long will that witness be?

  15            MR. DRATEL:  The second witness, maybe a half hour.

  16            THE COURT:  And the third witness?

  17            MR. DRATEL:  We have an expert, your Honor, whose

  18   testimony on direct will be an hour -- I don't know how long

  19   the government's cross will be, they anticipate, of the

  20   current witness.

  21            THE COURT:  Is this the witness you complained about

  22   lack of a report?

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  Both experts there is a lack of

  24   report but this was the adequacy of the report we complained

  25   about.  We will not be long with Mr. Odeh, so in terms of



                                                                4207



   1   planning you can budget 15 minutes for cross.

   2            If I can make a record, we did see exhibits for the

   3   first time with insertions about how things got erroneously

   4   put in the transcript by the government, things like that.  I

   5   will be making an objection in the future.  We are getting

   6   discovery of new documents over lunchtime, not just

   7   transcripts.  We were asking for reverse discovery for the

   8   last six months and then documents show up the morning of or

   9   at lunchtime.  We are just making a record in case we make a

  10   future application.

  11            The second thing is, we are getting serious

  12   logistical problems.  With regard to witnesses under the

  13   government's custody and control or under the government's

  14   protection, we need notice as to who is testifying or not.  It

  15   is causing some problems.  For example, I understand a retired

  16   general from the U.S. Army has been subpoenaed.  The

  17   Department of Defense advised us that the service was

  18   defective.  He has a business appointment and is supposed to

  19   be traveling.  He was subpoenaed to court for this Friday when

  20   there is no trial.  To hold somebody hostage --

  21            THE COURT:  By whom was he subpoenaed?

  22            MR. FITZGERALD:  By the El Hage team.

  23            MR. DRATEL:  To complete the record with respect to

  24   the other issues, the documents to which Mr. Fitzgerald

  25   referred that he received at lunch --



                                                                4208



   1            THE COURT:  Forget that.

   2            MR. DRATEL:  I want to make sure it is complete.

   3   Those documents he received days ago.  They were not stamped

   4   as exhibits.  What he received this afternoon are the same

   5   documents stamped as exhibits.  That's the only difference.

   6            With respect to the Jumas --

   7            THE COURT:  I want to make clear, whether the defense

   8   case one week or three weeks really isn't my concern.  I just

   9   think it is contrary to your client's interests to not have
