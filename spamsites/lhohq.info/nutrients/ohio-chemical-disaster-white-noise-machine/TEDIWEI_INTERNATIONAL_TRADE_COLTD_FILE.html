   1                         AFTERNOON SESSION

   2            (Time noted: 4:00 p.m.)

   3            THE COURT:  The note from the jury reads:  "The jury

   4   with like to request the following additional exhibits:

   5   GX350A, GX350, 357-T, 358-T, 359-T, 361-T, which we believe

   6   were obtained from Ali Mohamed's home.  Thank you for your

   7   assistance.  Juror No. 1."

   8            Any problems?

   9            MR. KARAS:  There were some questions on some of

  10   these, your Honor.  There is no problem with 350 or 350A.

  11   With respect to 357-T, 357 was the address book from Ali

  12   Mohamed, most of which is, or much of which is in English,

  13   which there is the translation which was requested, 357-T.

  14   There may be an entry that has some English and some Arabic.

  15   So 357-T would give the English portion of the entry.

  16            THE COURT:  Any objection to sending both 357 and

  17   357-T?

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  No objection.

  19            THE COURT:  Let's do that.

  20            Then with respect to 358, 358 is a letter that is

  21   mostly in English, and there is a small Arabic portion.  The

  22   request again was just for 3589T, but there is only a small

  23   portion in Arabic.  Send them both again?  Same issue.

  24            Silence is acquiescence.

  25            MR. KARAS:  And then 361 is the Egyptian passport of



                                                                6282



   1   Ali Mohamed, and again they have only asked for 361-T.  There

   2   are some entries in the passport that are in English and of

   3   course the translation only is of the non-English entries.

   4            THE COURT:  All right.  My note will say:  "Here are

   5   the exhibits you have requested.  You have asked for Exhibits

   6   357-T and 358-T and 361-T.  We have also enclosed Exhibits

   7   357, 358 and 361, portions of which are in English."

   8            MR. KARAS:  We would propose to send in the

   9   originals, and so as not to delay matters we can make copies

  10   and send in the copies later.

  11            THE COURT:  Yes.  And they say nothing about when

  12   they want to go home, so we will await further word from them

  13   and we will send the exhibits and this note in and we will

  14   await further guidance as to their wishes.

  15            (Court's Exhibits I and II duly marked)

  16            (Recess)

  17            THE COURT:  The jury has requested of the marshal

  18   that they go home at 4:30.  So if there is no objection, I

  19   will just tell them that they may leave at 4:30, and then at

  20   4:30 we will be adjourned until tomorrow morning.

  21            (Recess)

  22            (Proceedings adjourned until 9:30 a.m., Wednesday,

  23   May 16, 2001)
