<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  10   officers and employees of the United States Government, while

  11   such officers and employees were engaged in and on account of

  12   the performance of their official duties, and persons

  13   assisting such United States Government officers and employees

  14   in the performance of their duties, on account of that

  15   assistance.

  16            These counts appear in paragraph 38 of the

  17   indictment, and each count corresponds to an employee of the

  18   United States killed in the explosion at the United States

  19   Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on August 7, 1998.  In this regard,

  20   the stipulation marked Government Exhibit 42 -- not 39, as

  21   appears there, 42 -- is relevant.

  22            Counts 275 and 276 of the indictment charge defendant

  23   K.K. Mohamed with the murder of officers and employees of the

  24   United States in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  Specifically,

  25   Counts 275 and 276 charge:



                                                                6164



   1            On or about August 7, 1998, in Dar es Salaam,

   2   Tanzania, and outside the jurisdiction of any particular state

   3   or district, ... K.K. Mohamed ... [who] was first brought to

   4   and arrested in the Southern District of New York, and others

   5   known and unknown, unlawfully, deliberately, and maliciously,

   6   and with malice aforethought and with premeditation, did

   7   murder officers and employees of the United States Government,

   8   while such officers and employees were engaged in and on

   9   account of their official duties, and the persons assisting

  10   such United States Government officers and employees in the

  11   performance of their duties, on account of that assistance.

  12            These Counts appear in paragraph 42 of the

  13   indictment, and each count corresponds to an employee of the

  14   United States killed in the explosion at the United States

  15   Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on August 7, 1998.  And in

  16   this regard, the stipulation marked Government Exhibit 55 --

  17   55 -- is relevant.

  18            The statute that the defendants are charged with

  19   violating in these Counts provides:

  20            Whoever kills ... any officer or employee of the

  21   United States or of any agency in any branch of the United

  22   States Government (including any member of the uniformed

  23   services) while such officer or employee is engaged in or on

  24   account of the performance of official duties, or any person

  25   assisting such an officer or employee in the performance of



                                                                6165



   1   such duties or on account of that assistance is guilty of a

   2   crime.

   3            In these counts, the government further alleges that

   4   the defendants committed the killings with malice aforethought

   5   and with premeditation.

   6            To satisfy its burden of proof as to Counts 233

   7   through 273 and Counts 275 and 276, the government must prove

   8   each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:

   9            First, that the defendant you are considering killed,

  10   or aided and abetted the killing of, the victim charged in the

  11   that count;

  12            Second, that the victim was an officer or employee of

  13   the United States Government or of any agency in any branch of

  14   the United States Government and was engaged in or killed on

  15   account of the performance of his official duties at the time

  16   in question;

  17            Third, that the defendant acted unlawfully;

  18            Fourth, that the defendant acted with malice

  19   aforethought; and

  20            Fifth, that the defendant acted with premeditation.

  21            The first element of these counts that the government

  22   must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant you

  23   are considering killed, or aided and abetted the killing of,

  24   the victim charged in that count of the indictment.

  25            As I explained to you earlier, it is the government's



                                                                6166
