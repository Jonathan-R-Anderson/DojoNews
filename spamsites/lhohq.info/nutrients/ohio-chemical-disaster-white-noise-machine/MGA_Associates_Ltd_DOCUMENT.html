<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  25            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.  We'll submit something



                                                                3926



   1   next week indicating perhaps a proposed redacted indictment

   2   that's pruned.

   3            THE COURT:  All right.  Obviously some of the overt

   4   acts are then incorporated by reference in subsequent counts

   5   and you can't eliminate them in Count One.

   6            My next note was whether the firearm acts, 285 and

   7   286, a point raised in the motions to dismiss and I think the

   8   government's submission today, makes clear that the firearm is

   9   the bomb itself.  And that's, I think, not a matter of basis

  10   for dismissing the counts but simply to make clear that the

  11   firearm is, as said earlier on, the firearm includes a

  12   destructive --

  13            When I finish.

  14            MR. COHN:  Okay, Judge.  I just want to be heard.

  15            THE COURT:  Silence is not acquiescence.  I'm blocked

  16   out until 7:00.

  17            I have never seen the press look as distressed.

  18            Okay.  Two other points:  The government suggests a

  19   felony murder instruction as an alternate to premeditation.  I

  20   don't think the presence or absence of premeditation is going

  21   to be something which gives this jury any pause, and I propose

  22   not to include the felony murder charge because anything which

  23   can be done to simplify without affecting serious interests

  24   should be done.

  25            The government also asks for a conscious avoidance



                                                                3927



   1   instruction.  I know that I'm mixing the charge with the

   2   counts but I think of them as being so interrelated.

   3            Conscious avoidance in this context is very different

   4   from conscious avoidance in the money laundering context where

   5   the motive for people knowing only is on a need to know basis.

   6   In this context it is quite different.

   7            I note, just in passing, there's a little conflict

   8   between the Pinkerton theory and the conscious avoidance

   9   theory, but we have crossed that bridge.

  10            Here, if there is conscious avoidance, it wasn't for

  11   fear of criminal liability, which is, I think, the last thing

  12   that these defendants were thinking of, it was because

  13   envisioning themselves to be engaged in a quasi military

  14   operation and concerned of what informants might know and

  15   disclose, people were left out of the loop.  It is my intent

  16   not to charge on conscious avoidance.

  17            Venue.  Am I correct that the defendants have stated

  18   on the record and in their papers any and all objections they

  19   have to venue?

  20            Mr. Schmidt?

  21            MR. SCHMIDT:  Thank you.  Yes.

  22            THE COURT:  Does the defendant have any objection to

  23   venue other than as set forth in its submission?

  24            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, your Honor.

  25            THE COURT:  So that the record is absolutely clear,



                                                                3928



   1   the defendant Al-'Owhali concedes the existence of venue with

   2   respect to the false statement charged in the indictment --

   3   defendant El Hage?

   4            MR. SCHMIDT:  I don't believe we concede that, your

   5   Honor.

   6            THE COURT:  This is an area of the law in which

   7   silence is acquiescence, so I think you need to -- there are

   8   cases which hold that a defendant who fails in his Rule 29

   9   motion to make a challenge to venue waives that.

  10            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, then we challenge venue as

  11   to the Count 308.

  12            THE COURT:  What is the basis for venue?

  13            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, the investigation being

  14   conducted out of the Southern District of New York and the

  15   agent testified he did it in conjunction with Agent Coleman

  16   from New York, and the false statement would impact upon that

  17   investigation being conducted out of this district.

  18            THE COURT:  So that anywhere in, well, in the United

  19   States to which the agent would question a person on with

  20   respect to this investigation would have venue in Southern
