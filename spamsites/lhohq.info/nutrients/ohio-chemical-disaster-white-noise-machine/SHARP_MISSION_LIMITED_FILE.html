  20   and I had to be very careful.  It was hot, it was very hot on

  21   the pavement with my foot, but I just kept going.

  22            I just got this little song in my mind.  It was just

  23   like, I got to get to the embassy, I got to get to the

  24   embassy, and I just kept walking and walking.  And sometime a

  25   lot of people, a lot of people were going to the embassy.  You



                                                                7508



   1   could see the smoke.

   2            And people would come up to me and they would take my

   3   hand and they would start talking to me in Key Swahili and

   4   then they just kept saying it wasn't them, they didn't do it.

   5   They kept saying everything was going to be okay and they

   6   would walk with me for a ways and just hold my hand.

   7   Q.  How far was it from the hospital to the embassy?

   8   A.  I'm not really sure.  I know it's a couple of miles.  It

   9   felt like it was very far.  It's not really that far.

  10   Q.  What happened when you got to the embassy?

  11   A.  There were a lot of people there.  They were putting out

  12   the fires with the fire trucks and there were the TPDF.  The

  13   army men had come and they had sort of cordoned off the

  14   embassy.  And they didn't want to let me through and I said,

  15   no, I grabbed onto one of the security guards, I said, you've

  16   got to, I've got to get in, I've got to find people, I've got

  17   to talk to someone to find out what's happened.

  18            And he took me right in.  That's when I stood there

  19   and I saw the crater and I saw the front view of what had

  20   actually happened to the embassy.  I just, I couldn't believe

  21   it.

  22            The DCM, John Lange, saw me and he came running over.

  23   He asked me if I was okay.  And we talked about what had

  24   happened.  And then he said he had a car, I believe it was the

  25   French ambassador had given him a car to use because all our



                                                                7509



   1   cars had been destroyed, so he could take me to his house

   2   because that's where my husband would be.

   3            He didn't know what had happened.  And I went and I

   4   stood by the car, and my dress had ripped so I was like

   5   trailing just the bottom half.  Part of it was trailing behind

   6   me.  And of course I had no shoes, so I kept pulling up my

   7   dress with my hand so I could see where I was walking.

   8            And I was standing by the car, and all of a sudden

   9   this old man comes walking towards me, and he's bowed down

  10   like this and he has a rubber slipper in his hand.  It was

  11   this huge, it was like size 13 red rubber slipper that he was

  12   giving me to put to use on my foot.  And I remember my first

  13   thought was like, it's okay, I'm okay.  And then I realized he

  14   was giving me this gift, so I put it on.

  15            I got in the car with John Lange and we went to his

  16   house, and as I got out of the car I walked around the side of

  17   the car, and that's when I saw my husband was standing in the

  18   doorway of the house.  I was really happy to see him.

  19   Q.  Now --

  20            Go ahead, sorry.

  21   A.  Okay.  We just held one another.  I didn't know how bad it

  22   had been for him.  He was actually a couple of blocks away and

  23   when the bomb went off, he was in a Peace Corps vehicle.  They

  24   thought all the tires had been shot out of the vehicle or the

  25   tires had exploded or something, and they pulled over real



                                                                7510



   1   quick and they hopped out and they were looking at the tires

   2   and all of a sudden my husband looked up and he saw the smoke.

   3   He said he knew, he knew it was the embassy right then.

   4            So he went running down the street and people were

   5   running in the opposite direction saying an airplane had

   6   crashed into the embassy.  You know, my husband was, what?

   7   And as he came around the corner, of course, he was on the

   8   side where the bomb went off, and so he had, he called back to

   9   the Peace Corps.

  10            He arranged for medical people to come because the

  11   Peace Corps has a nurse and several medical facilities and

  12   equipment.  And he kept looking and looking and looking for

  13   me.  Nobody remembered seeing me.  He just didn't know for

  14   those hours what had happened.  So it's pretty good to see him

  15   again.

  16   Q.  And over the course of the days following the bombing, did

  17   you go back to the embassy on a number of occasions?

  18   A.  I was the Department of State liaison with the FBI.  I

  19   took FBI agents around the neighborhood, into diplomatic

  20   residences, spoke to the guards in Key Swahili, explaining to

  21   them what we were doing and why we were doing this as they

  22   gathered evidence.

  23            About a month later, I was in front of the embassy

  24   and I suffered a miscarriage and I had to be medivac-ed up to

  25   Nairobi to take care of it.



                                                                7511



   1   Q.  Is it fair to say that, without knowing what the cause is,

   2   you attribute the miscarriage to the bombing?

   3   A.  It's definitely linked in my mind.

   4   Q.  Let me show you a picture of an office, which has been

   5   marked Government Exhibit 3005 for identification.

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  If I could display that on the

   7   screen, your Honor, if there's no objection.

   8   Q.  Can you tell the jury, if their screens are working, what

   9   is it we are see in the photograph marked 3005?

  10   A.  This is my office and this is looking toward the front of

  11   the embassy.  You can see on the left-hand side that's where

  12   the window is with the grating.

  13            We went back in.  This is the very next day.  We went
