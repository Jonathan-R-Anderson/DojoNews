   9   Q.  Right.  You would wait and see what he told you, right?

  10   A.  He was shown certain things.  I presume from the things in

  11   the items that we had shown him the documents and things that

  12   he knew we knew certain things.

  13   Q.  Right.  But you never told him the information you had

  14   from other witnesses, did you?

  15   A.  I wouldn't tell him that information, no.

  16   Q.  And you didn't tell him that information?

  17   A.  I did not.

  18   Q.  Now, while you were talking to him you were taking notes,

  19   right?

  20   A.  Yes, I was.

  21   Q.  And when you weren't taking notes the other agent was

  22   taking notes, correct?

  23   A.  That's correct.

  24   Q.  And those notes were taken contemporaneously with the

  25   conversations you were having with Mr. Mohamed?

                            Perkins - cross/Stern

   1   A.  Yes, they were.

   2   Q.  And then after your interview of Mohammed was completed a

   3   few days later those notes were put into another form, a form

   4   of a narrative, correct?

   5   A.  Yes, sir, they were.

   6   Q.  But during the conversation it wasn't given to you in the

   7   same narrative form that was ultimately put down in the

   8   typewritten 302s was it?

   9   A.  Ask me that again, I'm sorry.

  10   Q.  Okay.  While you were having the conversation it wasn't a

  11   linear narrative from day one, the day he left Zanzibar, until

  12   the day you met him, was it?

  13   A.  No, sir.

  14   Q.  You talked about some things here and some things there?

  15   A.  That's correct.

  16   Q.  Now, one of the first things that you talked with him

  17   about was the experience he had in Afghanistan, right?

  18   A.  I'm trying to think when we first broached that subject.

  19   Q.  It's not even that important when it was.  That is a thing

  20   you talked to him about?

  21   A.  Yes, sir.

  22   Q.  And you knew that he went there around 1994 or 1995,

  23   right?

  24   A.  That's what he told me, yes.

  25   Q.  Well, did you have anything to tell you that that wasn't

                            Perkins - cross/Stern

   1   true?

   2   A.  I didn't have anything that necessarily contradicted what

   3   he was telling me.

   4   Q.  Yes.  As a matter of fact, you knew from speaking to

   5   Mr. Hamisi, the fruit juice or juice cafâ€š guy, that that's

   6   what he had told him, too, that he went to Afghanistan around

   7   that time, right?

   8   A.  I can't remember specifically what Mr. Hamisi said in

   9   terms of the time frame.  It may have been a broad time frame

  10   that he spoke of.

  11   Q.  Okay.  And when you talked about Afghanistan I want to

  12   make sure I understand, you're saying that he told you went

  13   there to help other Muslims, right?

  14   A.  He went to Afghanistan to train.

  15   Q.  But did he tell you that he was going because he wanted to

  16   help other Muslims?

  17   A.  That he would use that to help other Muslims if necessary
