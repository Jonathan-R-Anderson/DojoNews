<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  Is it your understanding that the system is set up so that

   6   both of those doors cannot be opened at the same time?

   7   A.  That's true.

   8   Q.  So you wait for the second door to open, and now you are

   9   into a corridor, still next to a window, where there is an

  10   officer inside in some kind of control station, correct?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  At that point, do you then show your hand under a blue

  13   light --

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  -- device to show that you have a stamp and that you have

  16   been approved through?

  17   A.  And the paperwork as well.

  18   Q.  And the paperwork authorizing your visit.

  19            And then you simply wait for an elevator, but do you

  20   have control over the elevator, or must you wait for a staff

  21   person to escort you on the elevator?

  22   A.  No, you have to -- there's no control over the elevator

  23   for the visitors.  You have to wait for a staff member.  In

  24   fact, there is an elevator designated for inmates and

  25   visitors.




                                                                7629


   1   Q.  Once someone comes to take you up to the ninth floor, now

   2   you are in a corridor between two inmate units on the ninth

   3   floor; is that correct?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  9 South and 9 North, 9 South obviously facing towards the

   6   south end of MCC, 9 North facing the north end of MCC.  And

   7   now you come to another door?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  Which carries a designation -- have you seen the letters

  10   SHU on that door?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  Do you understand those letters to stand for Special

  13   Housing Unit?

  14   A.  Yes, I do.

  15   Q.  You have to wait by that door until that is opened for

  16   you, correct?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And as you enter, now you are entering onto the entry area

  19   on 9 South?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  You again sign in at that point; is that correct?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And you described in front of you a metal grate door?

  24   A.  Grill door, yes.

  25   Q.  A grill door that's locked.  Before you are able to go,




                                                                7630


   1   though, from signing in through that metal door, are you again

   2   scanned with a metal detector, hand-held metal detector by an

   3   officer?

   4   A.  Yes, you have to remove any items that you may have,

   5   although you are only permitted to have a pen and whatever

   6   legal material you are carrying.  And your legal material is

   7   usually inspected and you are scanned, one is scanned again

   8   with a wand.

   9   Q.  And once you have been scanned and approved by the officer

  10   who has done that procedure, then the grate or the barred

  11   door, heavy barred door that you described is unlocked and you

  12   walk onto what is the 9 South unit; is that correct?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  Are there 9 South inmates wandering around 9 South?

  15   A.  There are not.

  16   Q.  And from 9 South you walk across the unit, and is there

  17   like a half a flight of stairs that takes you up to 10 South?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  You go up to the top of 10 South.

  20            Do you remember how you have to get the attention of

  21   the 10 South officer or the control officer?

  22   A.  Yes.  You pick up a phone and hang it up again.

  23   Apparently that signals the person inside that, or somebody,

  24   to click that door open.

  25   Q.  And that door clicks open.  It is a heavy metal door that




                                                                7631


   1   you can't see out of; is that correct?

   2   A.  That's true.

   3   Q.  And now you are in what you called the vestibule; what

   4   corrections officials would probably call a sallyport?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  To 10 South, correct?

   7            And looking at the diagram, where you have gotten to

   8   now is -- do you see the area on the far left of the diagram

   9   designated "office"?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  And just above the office do you see the small sallyport

  12   area and the two doors indicated that we are talking about?

  13   A.  Yes.
