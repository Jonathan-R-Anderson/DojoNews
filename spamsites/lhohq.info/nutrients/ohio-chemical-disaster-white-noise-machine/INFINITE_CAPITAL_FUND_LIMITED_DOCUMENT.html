   2   Q   Are those children because of their innocence when they

   3   die, do they go to paradise?

   4   A   Yes.  Because they are children.

   5   Q   Because they're children.

   6   A   Because they're children, you know, they are innocent

   7   children, and there is the hadith of the prophet that said

   8   that children will go to paradise.

   9   Q   In Muslim life, is the purpose of life to live as much

  10   like Mohamed and Allah as you can?

  11   A   Not like Allah.  Allah is God.  We can't be like God.

  12   Q   To be as much like Mohamed as you can?

  13   A   Yes.  We are taught in the Koran that Mohamed is what is

  14   called (NonEnglish spoken).  It's, we call it an example, like

  15   a real model.  Mohamed is a model citizen.  So every Muslim

  16   tries their best to live like that model Mohamed.  By the way,

  17   that same word is given to prophet Abraham in the Koran.

  18   Abraham is also a model.

  19   Q   And other prophets as well.

  20   A   Yes.

  21   Q   And there are many prophets that Christians don't even

  22   recognize as prophets.

  23   A   Yes.

  24   Q   Based on your interpretation of the life of Mohamed, would

  25   he have given his life to correct a wrong?



                                                                4678



   1   A   Given his life to correct the wrong?

   2   Q   Why.

   3   A   Definitely.  But this is the messenger of God, as Jesus

   4   was the messenger of God and Abraham and Moses were the

   5   messengers of God.  All the prophets of God, in fact, give

   6   their lives so that mankind can live.

   7   Q   When you say that you believe in the Bible --

   8   A   I believe in what Allah said in the Koran.  I believe in

   9   the Torah, which was revealed by God to Moses.  I believe mm

  10   in what we call the Injil in the Koran, or the gospel, that

  11   was revealed to Jesus, the songs of David revealed to the

  12   prophet David.

  13   Q   Do you believe that God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and

  14   killed everyone in those cities?

  15   A   I believe according to what we read in the Koran and what

  16   we read to the Bible that God punished everyone in Sodom and

  17   Gomorrah, yes.

  18            MR. BAUGH:  Thank you, your Honor.  No further

  19   questions.

  20            THE COURT:  Anything more from the defendants?

  21            MR. FITZGERALD:  Very briefly, Judge.

  22            THE COURT:  Mr. Fitzgerald on behalf of the United

  23   States.

   1   Q   Good afternoon, imam.

   2   A   Good afternoon.

   3   Q   I will be very brief.  I realize the prophet Mohamed is no

   4   longer with us.  What is your understanding what the prophet

   5   Mohamed would say about whether it is proper to drive a truck

   6   into a building and blow up everyone inside?

   7            MR. BAUGH:  Objection, your Honor.  It goes to the
