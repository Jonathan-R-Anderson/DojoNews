  23            MR. DRATEL:  To complete the record with respect to

  24   the other issues, the documents to which Mr. Fitzgerald

  25   referred that he received at lunch --



                                                                4208



   1            THE COURT:  Forget that.

   2            MR. DRATEL:  I want to make sure it is complete.

   3   Those documents he received days ago.  They were not stamped

   4   as exhibits.  What he received this afternoon are the same

   5   documents stamped as exhibits.  That's the only difference.

   6            With respect to the Jumas --

   7            THE COURT:  I want to make clear, whether the defense

   8   case one week or three weeks really isn't my concern.  I just

   9   think it is contrary to your client's interests to not have

  10   the matters proceed in a smooth fashion.

  11            What about this general who was subpoenaed for

  12   Friday?

  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, once we found out that

  14   there would not be a Somalia stip, I immediately subpoenaed a

  15   retired general who was in charge of the troops for the

  16   October 3 and 4 incidents.  If it was on Friday, that was an

  17   error.  I had spoken to him after service.  I explained to him

  18   that if a stipulation does work out that he won't be needed,

  19   that he might be needed.  I knew he traveled and therefore I

  20   wanted to try to reach him as soon as possible.  I also

  21   learned that the other retired general who was in charge of

  22   the American troops in Somalia, the quick reaction force

  23   subpoena had been returned unserved.  He is apparently out of

  24   the country now and I cannot locate him now.  This is the one

  25   that came back.



                                                                4209



   1            Third was the person who prepared the after-action

   2   report or was responsible for the after-action report there,

   3   which we still do not have.  We are trying our best to fill in

   4   the holes on the Somalia issue and that's the problem.

   5            THE COURT:  I accept that, but now -- and I take it

   6   this witness's only objection is to the time?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  I haven't spoken to the witness, but

   8   he was leaving on a business trip tomorrow.

   9            THE COURT:  For how long?

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  I got a message -- it sounds like a

  11   week or two.  He is going on an overseas trip.  He is retired

  12   but on business.  He has a subpoena for Friday.  The

  13   Department of Defense sent Mr. Schmidt a letter indicating the

  14   ways in which the subpoena was defective.  I haven't spoken to

  15   the general.

  16            THE COURT:  Today is Tuesday.  Can he be available

  17   Thursday?  Does anyone know?

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  Judge, I don't know what the government

  19   case is at this point as to Somalia.  We haven't gotten all

  20   the discovery material.

  21            THE COURT:  What do you want?  What do you want to be

  22   told to this retired general who is about to leave the country

  23   for a week?  You can't put a hold on him.
