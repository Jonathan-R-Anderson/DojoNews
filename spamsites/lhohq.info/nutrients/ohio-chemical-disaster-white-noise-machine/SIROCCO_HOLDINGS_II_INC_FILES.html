   8            (Government's Exhibit 2012D received in evidence)

   9   Q   Ma'am, can you tell us what that picture is?

  10            (Pause)

  11   A   That picture was taken at Tallahassee airport when my son

  12   came off the airplane after being stationed in Japan for a

  13   year.  I can remember the plane hadn't even landed, I could

  14   see it coming and I was already in tears, because I just

  15   wanted to hold my son in my arms, and we hugged for the

  16   longest time.  We hug a lot in my family.  We were very

  17   emotional with one another.  We showed affection all the time.

  18   Nathan was not ashamed to kiss me in front of anyone.  And

  19   hug.  We always hugged, always.

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  I'd next like to show, your Honor,

  21   Government Exhibit 2012E, another photograph.

  22            (Government's Exhibit 2012E received in evidence)

  23   Q   Did Nathan smile a lot?

  24   A   I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

  25   Q   Did Nathan smile a lot?



                                                                6886



   1   A   Practically all the time.  The same day he came home from

   2   Japan and when he walked in the house he threw his arms up and

   3   he goes:  I'm finally home.

   4   Q   Did there come a time when Nathan told you he joined the

   5   Marines security guard detachment?

   6   A   Yes.

   7   Q   Can you tell the jury about that?

   8   A   It was in Pendelton at the time.  He decided that he was

   9   going to join the MSG program.  I was a little apprehensive.

  10   I didn't quite understand what it was, and then I questioned

  11   him.  I said:  Is that like being the equivalent of a

  12   policeman?  And he laughed at his mother and he said:  No, no,

  13   no.  He says:  You know the little guys that stand in front of

  14   the embassy.

  15            And he heard my silence, and he knew, because his

  16   response was, Mom, just be happy for me.  But my heart had

  17   sunk because I knew that embassy duty could be dangerous.  And

  18   I told him:  I said:  Nathan, I said, I'm happy for you.  I

  19   know you know you want to do this.  And of course I've always

  20   backed my children 100 percent.  As long as anything they ever

  21   did was above board.  I was always there for them.  It was his

  22   life, and that's what he wanted to do.  I could not work for

  23   him to make him happy.  He had to be happy in his career.
