   1   such duties or on account of that assistance is guilty of a

   2   crime.

   3            In these counts, the government further alleges that

   4   the defendants committed the killings with malice aforethought

   5   and with premeditation.

   6            To satisfy its burden of proof as to Counts 233

   7   through 273 and Counts 275 and 276, the government must prove

   8   each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:

   9            First, that the defendant you are considering killed,

  10   or aided and abetted the killing of, the victim charged in the

  11   that count;

  12            Second, that the victim was an officer or employee of

  13   the United States Government or of any agency in any branch of

  14   the United States Government and was engaged in or killed on

  15   account of the performance of his official duties at the time

  16   in question;

  17            Third, that the defendant acted unlawfully;

  18            Fourth, that the defendant acted with malice

  19   aforethought; and

  20            Fifth, that the defendant acted with premeditation.

  21            The first element of these counts that the government

  22   must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant you

  23   are considering killed, or aided and abetted the killing of,

  24   the victim charged in that count of the indictment.

  25            As I explained to you earlier, it is the government's



                                                                6166



   1   burden to prove that the defendant's conduct was the direct

   2   cause of the victim's death.  That means simply that the

   3   government must prove that the defendant inflicted an injury

   4   or injures upon the victim from which the victim died, or

   5   aided and abetted another to inflict such injures.  The

   6   definition of "aiding and abetting" provided in Counts Five

   7   and Six is applicable to this element of these counts, as

   8   well.  Recall that with respect to the defendant Odeh, the

   9   government's theory is that he aided and abetted the

  10   commission of the crime.  The government does not allege that

  11   defendant Odeh physically carried out the crimes charged in

  12   Counts 233 through 273.

  13            The second element of these counts that the

  14   government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the

  15   victim in the count you are considering was an officer or

  16   employee of the United States Government or any agency or

  17   branch of the United States Government and was engaged in or

  18   killed on account of the performance of official duties at the

  19   time in question.  The law criminalizing the murder of

  20   officers and employees of the United States is designed to

  21   protect federal employees and federal functions.  I instruct

  22   you that individuals employed by United States embassies are

  23   officers and employees of the United States.

  24            This element may be satisfied in one of two ways.

  25   First, it is sufficient to satisfy this element for the



                                                                6167



   1   government to show you that, at the time in question, the

   2   victim you are considering was in fact an officer or employee

   3   of the United States engaged in the performance of his or her

   4   official duties.  Here, the government does not have to prove

   5   that the defendant you are considering knew that the victim

   6   was an officer or employee of the United States Government;

   7   nor must the government show that the defendant knew that the

   8   victim was engaged in the performance of his or her official

   9   duties.

  10            The second and alternative way for the government to

  11   satisfy this element is by showing that, at the time in

  12   question, the victim you are considering was an officer or

  13   employee of the United States who was killed on account of the

  14   performance of his or her official duties.  I instruct you

  15   that a person performs an "official duty" when acting within

  16   the scope of what he or she is employed to do.  Here, the

  17   government must prove that the defendant you are considering

  18   was motivated to kill the victim by that victim's performance

  19   of his or her official duties.

  20            The third element of these counts that the government

  21   must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant you

  22   are considering acted unlawfully.

  23            As I told you earlier, an act is done unlawfully if

  24   it is done without valid justification or excuse.  While the

  25   taking of a human life is a most serious matter, not all



                                                                6168
