   1   A.  No, sir, that's a mischaracterization.  I have testified

   2   that I don't make a prediction in terms of saying, yes, this

   3   person will be violent or, no, they will not be violent,

   4   because that's speculative and unscientific.

   5            What I do do is engage in a risk assessment where I

   6   establish the relative probability or statistical likelihood

   7   that this individual will commit an act of serious violence in

   8   prison, and that is what I offer.  Ultimately, it is the

   9   jury's consideration whether that risk is an acceptable risk

  10   or how high or low it is.

  11   Q.  Isn't it fair to say that you have never put a statistical

  12   number on the risk assessment?

  13   A.  Oh, no, sir, that is certainly incorrect.  In every case

  14   that I have testified I have described the base rate of

  15   violence among capital offenders.  In other words, a risk

  16   assessment of capital sentencing undertaken much like the

  17   automobile insurance industry, identifies the risk of an

  18   accident, that you take a group of similar individuals and you

  19   track your experience with them over time, and on the basis of

  20   that you identify a relative risk rate or statistical

  21   likelihood.

  22            That base rate is the most reliable anchor for a

  23   violence risk assessment in the absence of a clear pattern of

  24   behavior in prison or in confinement.  So, as I have done, as

  25   I have testified about violence risk assessment, I have




                                                                8189


   1   described those statistics, and if I in fact evaluated the

   2   defendant, will typically anchor or attach those statistics to

   3   him with some raising or lowering of that base rate depending

   4   on individual factors.

   5   Q.  Isn't it fair to say that in the end you have testified

   6   for a person even above the base rate that they were a low

   7   risk, yes or no, without qualifying it as being less than 50

   8   percent?  Have you testified that a person who was above the

   9   base rate constituted a low risk of violence in the Bobbit

  10   case, yes or no?

  11   A.  I don't recall my testimony specifically in the Bobbit

  12   case.  I apologize.

  13   Q.  Sir, how much do you expect to earn in this case?

  14   A.  You know, I don't know.  I know my billable rate, but I

  15   don't know what hours I have generated in this so far.  My

  16   secretary tracks that.

  17   Q.  How much do you charge per hour?

  18   A.  My fee is $210 per hour.

  19   Q.  And do you estimate how many hours have you spent on this

  20   case to date?

  21   A.  Gee, I don't know.  I made a trip out here several weeks

  22   ago and I have spent a good deal of time working on the ADX

  23   Florence disciplinaries and the terrorist and bomber

  24   disciplinaries.  I apologize.  I would expect that I have

  25   spent at least 50 hours in this case, and I think it could




                                                                8190


   1   well be more than that.
