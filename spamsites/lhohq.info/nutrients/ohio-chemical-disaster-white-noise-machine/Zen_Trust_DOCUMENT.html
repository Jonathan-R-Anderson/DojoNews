   4   for the property 43 Runda Estates, Nairobi, Kenya for the

   5   period May 1, 1998 through August 31, 1998.

   6            It is further stipulated and agreed that Government

   7   Exhibit 568A may be received in evidence as a Government

   8   Exhibit at trial.  It is further stipulated and agreed that

   9   this stipulation may be received in evidence as a Government

  10   Exhibit at trial.

  11            The government would offer the stipulation exhibit

  12   180 and the referenced exhibit, Government Exhibit 568A, at

  13   this time.

  14            THE COURT:  Received.

  15            (Government's Exhibits 568A and 180 received in

  16   evidence)

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  That's it for today, Judge.

  18            THE COURT:  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that's

  19   it for today.  That's it for this week, so that when we

  20   adjourn we are going to adjourn until Monday.

  21            I'm sorry not to have been able to give you more

  22   notice, but as you see what is happening is that a great many

  23   stipulations are being entered which obviate the need to call

  24   live witnesses, and this of course speeds things up

  25   considerably.  Because there are some witnesses who are



                                                                3506



   1   traveling from far off lands they are not available tomorrow

   2   or Thursday and we'll proceed on Monday.

   3            It is also our expectation that after next week we

   4   may have a break which could be as long as a week, which will

   5   I hope give you an opportunity to take care of some of your

   6   affairs and enjoy the holiday, and give the lawyers and the

   7   Court and opportunity to do some other matters.

   8            Be sure everybody stays well.  I remind you again,

   9   please not to read or listen to anything you may see in the

  10   media about this case, nor discuss this case with anyone.  I

  11   hope you have a pleasant respite from your business as a juror

  12   and we'll resume again Monday morning.

  13            Thank you.

   1            (Jury not present)

   2            THE COURT:  We're adjourned until Thursday at 10 a.m.

   3   at which time we'll take up the matters raised by Al-'Owhali's

   4   subpoenas, and the matters that were left with Mr. Schmidt

   5   concerning timing.

   6            A letter from a juror says:  Thank you for your

   7   constant consideration of the jurors' needs.  Your effort to

   8   expedite the trial is appreciated by all I am sure.  I do have

   9   a request, however.  I am finding the delivery of the

  10   information from various stipulations and numerous documents,

  11   especially letters, phone numbers, names and addresses to be

  12   much too rapid for me to record on paper and store in my mind,

  13   have something overly detail.

  14            This is the only trial I've ever been on, but could

  15   you ask the prosecutors to slow down in reading the kind of

  16   information listed above and leave the exhibits on the screen

  17   a bit longer.  Thank you very much.

  18            PS.  If you feel the details of these stipulations

  19   are something I need not be overly concerned about considering

  20   these, then proceed as is.

  21            (Laughter)

  22            Well, you know I have noticed that there are three or

  23   four jurors who are taking notes and have been attempting to

  24   record telephone numbers and so on.  The stipulations which

  25   have these numbers are in evidence and I would suggest that on



                                                                3508



   1   Monday morning I will tell them that the stipulations -- I

   2   feel like Price Waterhouse is handing me the envelopes -- that

   3   they will be able to see the stipulations if they request

   4   during their deliberations.  They laugh at it, but it is a

   5   reflection of how conscientious the jurors are.

   6            The next note is from a juror who has just received

   7   his master's degree and would like to attend the commencement

   8   ceremony being held on Thursday May 10th from 9:30 to 12.

   9            Would it be possible to begin the court session later

  10   in the day?  I'd be willing to leave the commencement at 11:30

  11   a.m. to be able to be in time for court.  I totally understand

  12   if you decide not to grant my request.

  13            Anybody object to the request being granted?  We will

  14   grant the request.  We're adjourned until Thursday 10 a.m.

  15   Those who are not involved in either the Al-'Owhali subpoenas

  16   or the discovery matters that Mr. Schmidt raised may absent

  17   themselves if they wish.

  18            (Adjourned to 10 a.m., Thursday, March 29, 2001)
