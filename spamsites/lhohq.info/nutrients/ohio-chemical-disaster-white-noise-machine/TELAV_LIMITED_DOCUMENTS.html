  19   inconvenience.  Is it possible for us to adjourn at 3:30 on

  20   Friday?"  Then she goes on to detail a birthday and a surprise

  21   party which her husband has told her that her children are

  22   planning for her.

  23            (Laughter)

  24            THE COURT:  It gives some reflection of the impact on

  25   which jury service impacts on people's everyday lives.  Unless




                                                                6027


   1   there is objection, we will adjourn early on Friday.

   2            MR. RICCO:  No objection.  Can we adjourn to the back

   3   to be heard on one brief matter?

   4            MR. COHN:  And I would like to be heard here.

   5            During Mr. Fitzgerald's rebuttal he mentioned for the

   6   second time during summations, the first time during

   7   Mr. Karas's summation, certain material that was shown to

   8   Mr. Al-'Owhali that caused him to confess, and I think what he

   9   said was pictures about Runda Estates and something about

  10   telephone numbers.  We searched the record both times and

  11   cannot find that.  If the government would favor us with a

  12   record reference, we won't make the motion that you instruct

  13   the jury that it never happened and that it be stricken.

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  We will do that.

  15            THE COURT:  Very well.  There was some other record

  16   inference?

  17            MR. WILFORD:  Yes, your Honor, page 5934.

  18            THE COURT:  What does it say?

  19            MR. WILFORD:  The portion of the transcript.

  20            MR. BAUGH:  Excuse me.  We are advised the

  21   translators cannot hear.

  22            MR. WILFORD:  We will speak loudly.

  23            THE COURT:  You can do that?

  24            MR. WILFORD:  Only when I have the microphone.  Your

  25   Honor, it's a portion of the transcript where Mr. Fitzgerald




                                                                6028


   1   is talking about an argument of Mr. Schmidt in terms of being

   2   a facilitator and what was needed to succeed as a facilitator.

   3   Then he goes on to say, particularly at line 12, Kherchtou

   4   explained it to you.  You don't have to shoot the gun if you

   5   are helping someone else you know is going to do it.  I think

   6   that is an oblique reference that Kherchtou pled guilty to the

   7   activities.

   8            THE COURT:  Overruled.

   9            MR. RICCO:  Your Honor, I might as well raise it

  10   since we are here.  I only have one point with respect to Mr.

  11   Fitzgerald's summation, and that was his explanation to the

  12   jury of what PETN is -- they can't hear?  My only objection is

  13   to what Mr. Fitzgerald said PETN is and how it was used in

  14   connection with this case.  He said it was only used in

  15   connection with detonator caps and explaining the role of

  16   Mohamed Odeh.  But the transcripts in the case said at page

  17   2483, the testimony of Kelly Mount, the question is, can you

  18   tell us whether or not PETN is a high explosive?  Answer, PETN

  19   is also a high explosive, yes.  Question, do you know what

  20   kind of use PETN is in connection with explosives?  Answer, it
