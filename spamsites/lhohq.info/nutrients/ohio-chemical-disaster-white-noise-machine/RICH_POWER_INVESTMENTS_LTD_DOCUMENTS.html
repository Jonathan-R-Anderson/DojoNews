  17   opposition leader whose followers were devout Muslims who the

  18   government opposed.  And if you recall, there was a phone call

  19   to the apartment where Kherchtou was living in, one phone

  20   call.  And that's because apparently Khalid al Fawwaz knew

  21   Sheik Bailala from the time that Sheik Bailala was in Saudi

  22   Arabia going to school.  One phone call to that apartment, and

  23   the next day the apartment was raided and everybody in the

  24   apartment put in jail.

  25            Now, of course Mr. Kherchtou couldn't know for a fact



                                                                5695



   1   that that was the result of it, but there was no other

   2   information concerning why that apartment was raided except

   3   for the next day, after a conversation with Sheik Bailala,

   4   everyone is in jail.

   5            And many many of the Kenyan authorities have to be

   6   paid off to take people out of jail, not because they

   7   committed crimes, because they associated with a Kenyan

   8   opposition leader.  Remember what I talked to you about the

   9   third world is not the United States.  Do not compare what

  10   goes on and the motivations of people in there as you would

  11   react in here, in the United States.

  12            But we don't have just simply a phone call to an

  13   opposition leader or from an opposition leader at Wadih El

  14   Hage's home, we have members of parliament calling him and him

  15   calling them.  Ministers, police officers, that's Mr. Salim

  16   Kheir, letters written to the commissioner of police, letters

  17   written to President Moi.

  18            Mohamed Ali Odeh, Oudeh, who is using the telephones,

  19   who is using the computer, who is using the fax machine.  The

  20   other people were doing business, the two guards Rashid and

  21   Ali, in and out of the home, using the telephone, using the

  22   fax machine for business.  We don't just simply have business

  23   activity and the non-governmental organizational activity on a

  24   level simply to provide a front that there is really nothing

  25   going on there, we have activity swirling all around.  And the



                                                                5696



   1   concept of running a terrorist cell whose goals are to murder

   2   Americans and having all these people around, having them

   3   access to your computer just doesn't make sense.  Doesn't make

   4   sense at all.

   5            And if you compare the computer that is seized in

   6   Wadih El Hage's house, there was a hidden file prepared by

   7   Harun that Wadih El Hage obviously could never have seen

   8   because he wasn't in when it was prepared and seized, what has
