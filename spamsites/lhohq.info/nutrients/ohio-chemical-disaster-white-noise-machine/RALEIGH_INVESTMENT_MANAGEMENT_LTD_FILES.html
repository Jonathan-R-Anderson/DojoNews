  16   A.  At the Metropolitan Correctional Center.

  17   Q.  At what is your job at MCC?

  18   A.  I'm the lieutenant.

  19   Q.  How long have you been with the Bureau of Prisons?

  20   A.  12 years.

  21   Q.  As part of your duties, have you been assigned to the 10

  14   different points on the unit at that time?

  15   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And as far as you were aware, could any of the monitors

  20   and the machines in that office at that time, did any of them

  21   have the capability of taping?

  22   A.  Yes, one.

  23   Q.  As far as you were aware, one?
