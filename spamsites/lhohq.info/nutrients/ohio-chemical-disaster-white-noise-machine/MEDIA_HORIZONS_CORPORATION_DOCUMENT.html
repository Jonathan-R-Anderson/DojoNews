<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">   7   business trip and met with Dr. Atef.  He and his friends say

   8   hello to you.  Harun told me he gave you the telephone number

   9   of the furniture and textile company.  Etc., etc.  We know

  10   Dr. Atef is Abu Hafs.  We reference the conversation with

  11   Wadih El Hage giving the satellite telephone number because

  12   Dr. Atef has moved the clinic and Harun might want to move his

  13   family there.  So there you have what is specifically an

  14   attempted coded reference to Abu Suliman that he was on a

  15   business trip and met with Dr. Atef, and to assure that

  16   Dr. Atef and others in the headquarters in Afghanistan say

  17   hello.

  18            Then you have Government's Exhibit 3B-T, the Taliban

  19   report found on El Hage's computer.  It discusses all the

  20   dynamics of the Taliban in Afghanistan.  On El Hage's computer

  21   you see a document that is signed there your brother Abu Hafs.

  22   Then Government's Exhibit 245-T is a translation of the report

  23   that was sent out that we know from that letter to Abu

  24   Khadija.  You see the report is identical in substance but

  25   there is no Abu Hafs at the bottom, because El Hage wants to



                                                                5540



   1   make sure if for some reason there is a headache that somebody

   2   may get, nobody can connect him to Abu Hafs or Khadija or

   3   anybody else.

   4            Government's Exhibit 611 is the letter we just read,

   5   and that's the letter that Taysir and his friends are still

   6   hiking.  One of the references to Abu Hafs, we know al Hajj is

   7   Bin Laden.  Then Government's Exhibit 438A, this is an Arabic

   8   letter and 438B is the translation.  What you see in this

   9   letter, and this is from Harun to Ihab Ali, Abu Suliman

  10   Nawawi, and Harun says, there is a greeting and he says at the

  11   bottom of the first page, the fish people are doing all right.

  12   However the project has failed and they are now reorganizing

  13   things to start a new business trip.  So there is a reference

  14   from Harun talking about the fish people in the Al Qaeda cell

  15   in East Africa.  He says Wadih went on a trip, he is with

  16   Taysir, and their situation is very comforting.  They are

  17   doing well and in good health.  They live in their own old

  18   town.  Hyatabad, Kherchtou talked about Hyatabad.  It is in

  19   Pakistan, on the border.  So you have Harun keenly aware where

  20   El Hage is.  He is not going to say the military command of Al

  21   Qaeda, and he says Taysir, and of course Ihab Ali knows who it

  22   is.

  23            Other references, and now we will go to the phone

  24   books and some of the phone records.  El Hage's phone book,

  25   the pop-up phone book, Government's Exhibit 304, page 27 of



                                                                5541



   1   that.  There is a reference right there.  It will be under

   2   listing T.  Taysir, 272177.  We will see again, looking at the

   3   mobile phone records for the special phone that is supposed to

   4   be used for El Hage -- this is Government Exhibit 621C.  You

   5   see a call from a number in Pakistan, and this is on 3

   6   February 1997, just before El Hage goes on his trip to

   7   Pakistan, and then the 521, the country and city code, 372177,

   8   and you see it says Pakistan.  So looking at just the listing

   9   in El Hage's own address book, when he says I don't know

  10   Taysir, it's impossible to square that with what is in his

  11   address book and the telephone records when he is calling the

  12   person he says is Taysir right before he goes to visit Bin

  13   Laden in February 1997.

  14            The wiretap calls.  Government's Exhibit 205A-T.

  15   This is a conversation that takes place November 12, 1996.  At

  16   the bottom of page 1, Saif al Islam and El Hage speaking to

  17   one another, and Saif al Islam says do you have any news for

  18   me from our brother Taysir?  At the top of the second page, El

  19   Hage doesn't say, as he did in the grand jury, I don't know

  20   Taysir, he says no, by God, it's over three months, Suliman

  21   sent us a fax in which he said everything was good and their

  22   situation was good.

  23            Government's Exhibit 207C-T, and this is a

  24   conversation on December 17, 1996 there is something

  25   important, you can decide it, Saad interrupts and says he is



                                                                5542



   1   here, and El Hage doesn't say who, he says but the people

   2   concerning the project, the project's money, and they go on to

   3   talk about whatever it is that the project is, and of course

   4   it involves Dr. Atef, one of the aliases, you know, for Abu

   5   Hafs and Taysir.  Then Government's Exhibit 218-T, we won't go

   6   through it again.  There is the conversation with El Hage.

   7   That's the satellite phone.  Government's Exhibit 209A-T, this

   8   is a conversation between April El Hage and Abu Khadija, and

   9   we know that Abu Khadija, as per witness Kherchtou, one of the

  10   aliases for Abu Hafs, and we know that after that conversation

  11   April El Hage, after dialing again and again, tells Wadih El

  12   Hage, Abu Khadija called the other one.

  13            Government's Exhibit 594 shows the call that we just

  14   looked at did originate from the satellite phone.  If you line

  15   up what is on the satellite phone records with what is on that

  16   conversation that is intercepted, you see that call came from

  17   the satellite phone to Bin Laden headquarters phone.

  18            Finally, Government's Exhibit 221A-T, this is a

  19   conversation on September 18, 1997, one week before El Hage

  20   testifies in the grand jury, and the caller says Abu Hafs says

  21   when he is coming here, April Hage says I don't know.  The

  22   unidentified male says you don't know.  And then down at the

  23   bottom, unidentified male, fourth line from the bottom, says
