<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">  21            THE COURT:  Why wait until 4:30?

  22            MR. BAUGH:  To start the charge conference?  We can

  23   do it either way.

  24            MR. COHN:  Does your Honor mean, why wait until 4:30

  25   to make a decision about whether Mr. al-'Owhali stays?



                                                                7091



   1            THE COURT:  The remaining business is for me to

   2   listen to the, I think, 13 minutes I have left of that tape,

   3   make a ruling as to its admissibility, and then proceed with

   4   the charging conference.

   5            MR. BAUGH:  That's it.

   6            THE COURT:  And if Mr. al-'Owhali wishes to remain

   7   for the charging conference, he may do so.  If he wishes to

   8   return now, he may do so.

   9            MR. BAUGH:  Thank you.

  10            MR. RUHNKE:  What time do we adjourn to start the

  11   charge conference?

  12            THE COURT:  Quarter after 4.

  13            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, for the record, there's

  14   one more videotape the defense is offering to which the

  15   government is not objecting, and that's the Koran and the

  16   Kalashnikov videotape.  But that you do not need to review.

  17            THE COURT:  How long is that?

  18            MR. BAUGH:  About 50 minutes.  That's our last thing

  19   in the morning.  That's on the history of Bin Laden and al

  20   Qaeda.

  21            THE COURT:  All right.  So that closing statements

  22   will likely begin?

  23            MR. BAUGH:  Around noontime.

  24            THE COURT:  Very well.  Okay.

  25            (Recess)



                                                                7092



   1            THE COURT:  I have viewed the tape and I have some

   2   comments and some questions.  The tape has Halliday again, so

   3   it will be Halliday for the third time saying essentially the

   4   same thing, and it also has the clip from "60 Minutes" with

   5   Madeleine Albright, which the jury has already seen.  And then

   6   there are the photographs of the malnourished children, which

   7   the jury has also seen.

   8            Apart from that, this is a film produced by a

   9   coalition of religious leaders urging the end of the Iraq

  10   embargo because "to kill innocent people is against God's

  11   law," and I have a number of problems with it.  One is the

  12   repetitious nature of it.  My question is, what is added to

  13   what has already before the jury by the playing of these 18

  14   minutes?

  15            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, if I might, your Honor.  The

  16   18 minutes of the "Silent Weapon" tape do indicate a different

  17   perspective than that which has been put forward with the

  18   other embargo tapes.  I will concede, as the Court has

  19   indicated, that there is some repetition.  There are some

  20   original photos in this tape and there are some different

  21   perspectives.  However, I hope the Court understands that what

  22   I'm doing is I'm not trying to be repetitious, it's just that

  23   whenever you do a death case, when you lose one -- I have lost

  24   one -- you constantly kick yourself saying maybe I should have

  25   done this, maybe I should have done more here, I should have



                                                                7093



   1   done more here, and that bedevils you for years afterwards.

   2            I can tell you I have had a lot of reservations.  I

   3   was up until early this morning wondering, because we were

   4   pulling things we didn't want to use.  We had many tapes we

   5   pulled out because we want to cut to the issue.  But at the

   6   same time you have this fear that if I get enough in, they

   7   will understand it, they will look at it; maybe if you put it

   8   from one perspective, you be put it from another, they can get

   9   it.

  10            I would ask the Court for an 18-minute gap of leeway.

  11   The BBC tape is not about this at all.  There are some

  12   different perspectives in this tape, I think you will agree,

  13   than the other that we have seen on the situation.

  14            I would also remind the Court --

  15            THE COURT:  I'm certainly not going to allow Halliday

  16   and the Albright clip again.  That's pure repetition.

  17            MR. BAUGH:  That is pure repetition and it just comes

  18   with it and we don't have the capability to edit -- if we can

  19   cut it out, fine.  If you want me to cut it off, I'll have

  20   somebody do it.  Believe me, I'll find somebody to get it

  21   done.

  22            THE COURT:  But apart from what's left from that is a

  23   plea by bishops and other clergymen for the ending of the

  24   embargo because killing innocent people is against God's law.

  25            Now, would we permit that testimony live?  Would we



                                                                7094



   1   permit a theologian to testify concerning his opposition to

   2   the Food For Oil Program and the embargo?

   3            MR. BAUGH:  Throughout the guilt phase of this case,

   4   which of course the United States has adopted for the penalty

   5   phase, words like "evil" and "heinous" have been used for the

   6   acts committed in Nairobi.  And they were.  I will concede

   7   that.  However, I think it is imperative that the jury

   8   understand that one thing that is different about this case is

   9   that we have a defendant charged with a case who -- when I
