<span style="margin-right:10%;white-space:pre-wrap;color: #00cc33; font-size: 200%; font-weight:bold">   5   agreement to disobey or disregard the law has been established

   6   by direct proof.  However, because conspiracy is by its very

   7   nature characterized by secrecy, you may also infer its

   8   existence from the circumstances of this case and the conduct

   9   of the parties involved.

  10            In a very real sense then, in the context of

  11   conspiracy cases, actions often speak louder than words.  In

  12   this regard you may, in determining whether an agreement

  13   existed, consider the actions and statements of all those

  14   persons you find to be participants as proof that a common

  15   design existed on the part of the persons charged to act

  16   together to accomplish an unlawful purpose.

  17            However, remember that if you choose to consider a

  18   defendant's postarrest statements made to law enforcement

  19   officials for purposes of determining the existence and scope

  20   of the alleged conspiracy, you may only consider those

  21   postarrest statements in connection with the specific

  22   defendant who made those postarrest statements.  In order for

  23   you to find that the existence and scope of the alleged

  24   conspiracy has been proven in connection with those defendants

  25   who did not make the postarrest statements at issue, you will




                                                                6079


   1   have to rely on evidence other than the postarrest statements.

   2            To recap, it is sufficient to establish the existence

   3   of the conspiracy if, from the proof of all the relevant facts

   4   and circumstances, you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the

   5   minds of at least two alleged coconspirators met in an

   6   understanding way to accomplish, by the means alleged, the

   7   objective of the conspiracy.

   8            In finding the existence of the conspiracy, you must

   9   also conclude that the conspiracy in fact had the unlawful

  10   purpose specifically alleged in the indictment.  If you find

  11   beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspirators agreed to

  12   accomplish the illegal objective charged in the indictment,

  13   the illegal purpose element of the conspiracy offense will be

  14   satisfied.  And if the indictment alleges that a given

  15   conspiracy had more than one unlawful purpose, then you need

  16   only find that the conspirators agreed to accomplish any of

  17   those multiple unlawful objectives.  Although the finding of

  18   one unlawful objective is sufficient to satisfy the illegal

  19   purpose element, I instruct that you the jury must unanimously

  20   agree on which, if any, was the specific unlawful objective of

  21   the alleged conspiracy.

  22       On the special verdict form, if you find that the charged

  23   conspiracy existed, you must indicate unanimous agreement as

  24   to the conspiracy's specific unlawful objectives.

  25       If the government fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt




                                                                6080


   1   that at least one of the unlawful purposes alleged in the

   2   indictment was in fact an objective of the conspiracy named in

   3   a particular count, or if you cannot unanimously agree as to

   4   which of the unlawful purposes alleged in that count of the

   5   indictment have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then

   6   you must find the defendants named in the count not guilty as

   7   to that conspiracy charge.

   8       Moreover, if you conclude that an agreement existed but

   9   that its purpose, even if unlawful, was in fact not one of the

  10   specific unlawful purposes described in that count of the

  11   indictment, you must also find the defendants named in that

  12   count not guilty.

  13            Just a few more general points relating to this first

  14   element of the offense of conspiracy.

  15       First, while the indictment may allege that a given

  16   conspiracy existed on certain dates, it is not essential that

  17   the government prove that the conspiracy started and ended on

  18   those specific dates.  Instead, it is enough if you find that

  19   the conspiracy was formed and that it existed for some

  20   substantial time within the period set forth in the

  21   indictment.

  22            Second, a conspiracy, once formed, is presumed to

  23   have continued until its objectives are accomplished or there

  24   is an affirmative act of termination by its members or it is

  25   otherwise terminated.




                                                                6081


   1            Third, you heard me repeatedly use the terms

   2   "unlawful purpose," "unlawful objective," "illegal purpose,"

   3   "illegal objective" in discussing the elements of the offense

   4   of conspiracy.  Understand that these terms are all synonymous

   5   and that they refer only to violations of United States law.

   6   As I said before, the crime of conspiracy applies only to

   7   those illegal agreements that seek to violate United States

   8   law.  An agreement to violate foreign law standing alone does

   9   not satisfy the illegal purpose element of the offense of
