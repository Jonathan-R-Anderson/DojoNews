  12   Q   Good afternoon, Agent Doran.

  13   A   Good afternoon, Mr. Wilford.

  14   Q   How are you?

  15   A   Good, thanks.

  16   Q   Now, would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury

  17   how long you've been an FBI agent?

  18   A   Just over five years.

  19   Q   As part of your duties as an FBI agent were you assigned

  20   to participate in the investigation of the bombing of the

  21   embassy in Nairobi?

  22   A   I was.

  23   Q   And as part of your duties concerning that investigation

  24   were you assigned to remove evidence from various places and

  25   take that evidence to various places?



                                                                4718



   1   A   Can you repeat that?  Was I assigned to take away

   2   evidence?

   3   Q   Did you pick up evidence from the evidence locker or from

   4   other people and bring it to the New York field office?

   5   A   No.

   6   Q   You did not?

   7   A   No.

   8   Q   Did you ever pick up evidence and take it anywhere?

   9   A   My name appears on a chain of custody for a number of

  10   items of evidence because at the time that the investigation

  11   started, the case was being run out of the Washington field

  12   office.  When the case became a New York case, I went through

  13   and administratively put my name on parcels of evidence, but

  14   as for taking evidence of searches, no.

  15   Q   Not for searches, but you did pick up evidence from the

  16   Washington field office and take it to New York?

  17   A   No.

  18   Q   Did you ever pick up evidence on February 22 of this year?

  19   A   I don't recall.

  20            MR. WILFORD:  Your Honor, may I approach the witness?

  21            THE COURT:  Yes.

  22   Q   I want to show you two items that have been previously

  23   Bates stamped 1B375 and 1B slash 39-3 and I've highlighted the

  24   areas.

  25   A   Okay.  These weren't brought from Washington.  These were



                                                                4719



   1   brought from the New York FBI office to the Southern District

   2   of New York.

   3   Q   Now, Agent Doran, would it be fair to say that you picked
