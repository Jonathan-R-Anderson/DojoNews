  19   A.  Yes, I give them information, you're right.

  20   Q.  Okay.  Since that time has the Witness Protection Program

  21   paid you $794,200.49?

  22   A.  Could you repeat it?

  23   Q.  Has the Witness Protection Program since 1999 paid you

   9   A.  I didn't count it.

  10   Q.  Since 1999?

  11   A.  I never count it.  Every month they give me money for my

  12   rent, my house, and some money for food and my bills, that's

  13   it.

  14   Q.  Additionally, since 1997 has the FBI paid you $151,047.02?
