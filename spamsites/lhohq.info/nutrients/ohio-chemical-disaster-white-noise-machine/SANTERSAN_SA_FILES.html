  24   Q.  Was convicted on January 1st, 1995?

  25   A.  Yes, sir.




                                                                8215


   1   Q.  He would be a pretrial inmate for the first five years?

   2   A.  Yes, sir.

   3   Q.  And then a convicted inmate doing a designated Bureau of

   4   Prisons time for the balance?

   5   A.  That's correct.

   6   Q.  The raw data you received was the data starting at 1990,

   7   but so we are clear, in terms of after-sentencing admission,

   8   which is what you designated on the chart, would start from

   9   January 1, 1995 for that hypothetical?

  10   A.  That's correct.

  11   Q.  Forgetting the first however many years Mr. Ajaj was in

  12   prison as a pre-sentence inmate, did you see any conduct post

  13   sentencing that caused you concern about security besides the

  14   assault listed?

  15   A.  Do you want me to report the disciplinaries that he was

  16   written up for?

  17   Q.  No, I just want to see if there was anything that struck

  18   you as a particular concern in reviewing those records that

  19   would cause particular concern about security for Ahmad

  20   Mohammad Ajaj other than the assault, yes or no; and if yes,

  21   tell me what it is.  Post sentence.

  22   A.  There is an assault without serious injury on March the

  23   12th, 1994.  His original date of sentencing was in 1993.  So

  24   that would have been after the original sentence.  He has a

  25   number of other disciplinaries, again that I think all have




                                                                8216


   1   security significance but not the significance of an assault

   2   or a dangerous weapon.

   3   Q.  Okay.

   4   A.  In other words, an inmate who has no write-ups whatsoever

   5   has a better security profile in many ways than one that has

   6   three, four, eight, ten write-ups, even if they are for

   7   non-violent sorts of things, but we are most concerned with

   8   tracking the violence incidents in terms of looking at base

   9   rates of violence in prison.

  10   Q.  Are you aware that in May 1995 Ahmad Ajaj was caught

  11   dialing a staff phone, and then in May 1997 he was caught

  12   using the mail or phone without authorization, and that on

  13   December 23rd, 1999, he was caught making a three-way call,

  14   which means a call patched through to a different number,

  15   which would defeat the prison phone-monitoring system?

  16   A.  Yes, sir.  He has several write-ups for unauthorized phone

  17   calls.

  18   Q.  Are you aware that Ahmad Mohammad Ajaj was first taken

  19   into custody in late August to early September 1992, with an

  20   immigration violation, was found to be in possession of bomb

  21   manuals, and that thereafter, while incarcerated in a federal

  22   facility, he was making telephone calls, including three-way

  23   telephone calls, to try to get his then lawyer to surrender to

  24   obtain a bomb manual so that he could get it to the World

  25   Trade Center bombers?




                                                                8217


   1   A.  I'm not familiar with the specifics of his case.  All the

   2   information that I have about these individuals was in the

   3   packet that you provided.

   4   Q.  So given that, when you looked at this chart, you did not

   5   include in this chart the three instances where he tried to

   6   use a staff phone, use a phone or mail without authorization,

   7   or was caught making a three-way call; it is not reflected on

   8   this chart of incidents that happened after sentencing,

   9   correct?

  10   A.  That's correct.

  11            I did, as I did that, evaluate what sort of sanctions

  12   the individual may have come under in terms of trying to

  13   identify how seriously did the staff regard the particular

  14   incident.  And so, for example, on 6/23, the consequence was a

  15   loss of phone privileges for 60 days.

  16   Q.  My question to you simply was, you didn't reflect those

  17   incidents on the chart?

  18   A.  The answer is yes, not on the chart.  I thought about

  19   them, but not on the chart.

  20   Q.  Now, with regard to Mr. Nidal Ayyad, the fourth person

  21   listed on that chart -- I'm sorry.  If we could go down, Fares

  22   Khallafalla, Mohammed Saleh, Victor Alvarez, Fadil Abdelgani,

  23   Amir Abdelgani, Clement Hampton-El, are you aware that all of

  24   those people were convicted of the crimes of conspiring to

  25   carry out a bombing that did not take place or were not




                                                                8218


   1   convicted of an actual bombing?

   2   A.  That's my understanding.

   3   Q.  And are you aware that their sentences ranged generally
