  18   say, here's a document written by the defendant at some

  19   earlier date.

  20            MR. SCHMIDT:  Are we talking about authentication

  21   issues?

  22            THE COURT:  Both.  Start with that.

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  Authentication issues, your Honor,

  24   simply authentication, a person testifying that that appears

  25   to be the handwriting of a particular person authenticates the



                                                                4972



   1   document.

   2            THE COURT:  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't.

   3            MR. SCHMIDT:  Also authenticating the document.

   4            THE COURT:  It may establish the fact that the

   5   document is written by the defendant when it was written, who

   6   it was shown to, or what are the circumstances.

   7            MR. SCHMIDT:  If the document itself --

   8            THE COURT:  No, no, it's not self-authenticating.

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  The date of it.

  10            THE COURT:  Oh, please, Mr. Schmidt.  If the

  11   defendant sits down today and writes a document and the fact

  12   that somebody else says, oh, that's his handwriting, that's

  13   not enough.

  14            MR. SCHMIDT:  You're right.  You're absolutely right.

  15   This is a document that is dated July 15, 1995.

  16            THE COURT:  What is the proof that that is in fact

  17   the date on which the document was written?

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  That the date relates to the business

  19   transaction that he had in Slovakia and we have another

  20   document that comes from his computer that's seized by the

  21   government that is dated, that is about the same topic that

  22   authenticates that document.
