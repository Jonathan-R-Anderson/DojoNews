  15   Q.  Now, you're aware that even in Florence, if we assume for

  16   the moment Florence Administrative Maximum, not even a regular

  17   penitentiary, that in that sallyport area where a person steps

  18   through the solid door and is by the grill, they are now

  19   exposed through the wicket if the inmate seeks to grab it,

  20   correct?

  21   A.  Well, they are out of arm's length in terms of an inmate

  22   attempting to grab them, unless they step up closer to the

  23   grate.

  24   Q.  Well, they are going to put their hands through and

  25   handcuff the inmate, so wouldn't they be, by definition,




                                                                8207


   1   within arm's length if they are touching the inmate's hands?

   2   A.  As the inmate backs up to them, he is putting his hands

   3   through the wicket.  Now, if he attempted to spin on them,

   4   then potentially he could try to access them, but that

   5   requires both a spin and then some kind of a jab before the

   6   person who is there can step back out of arm's length.

   7   Q.  Well, let me ask this in two questions.  From your review

   8   of the reports, did you read two reports where inmates stabbed

   9   correction officers with pens while the officers were in the

  10   grill; yes or no?

  11   A.  No, sir.  I recall an instance where an inmate struck an

  12   officer in the face.  I don't recall officers being stabbed,

  13   although that may have been -- if it was 1999, I don't have

  14   those reports.

  15   Q.  So you will agree with me that when the officer was struck

  16   in the face, he clearly was in arm's length of the inmate,

  17   correct?

  18   A.  In that instance, certainly.

  19   Q.  And you told us earlier that when inmates step into the

  20   grill between the solid door and the grill in that sallyport

  21   area, sometimes liquids are thrown, correct?

  22   A.  When a staff member steps into the sallyport?

  23   Q.  Yes.  I'm sorry.

  24   A.  Then sometimes an inmate throws liquids from the interior

  25   of the cell or spits on them, yes.




                                                                8208


   1   Q.  And the liquids most often thrown are urine and feces,

   2   correct?

   3   A.  There's a lot of spitting.  Sometimes the liquid is

   4   unknown, sometimes food.  But there is urine and feces, yes.

   5   Q.  Would it be fair to say that in those disciplinary reports

   6   there is a fair amount of reports showing urine and feces

   7   being saved up by an inmate and thrown on the officer when he

   8   steps into that area between the door and the grill, correct?

   9   A.  There are a number of those reports, that's correct.

  10   Q.  And if an officer loses his cool or her cool at that time,

  11   they are within arm's length of the inmate, correct?

  12   A.  I'm not sure I understand "losing their cool."  If they

  13   should approach the front of the grate in response to that?

  14   Q.  Yes.  When urine or feces is thrown in their face, if they

  15   should approach the grate, they would be within arm's length

  16   of an inmate, correct?

  17   A.  Assuming that the inmate was right up at the grate,

  18   certainly.

  19   Q.  And on a typical day in the Florence ADX facility, in

  20   addition to the time when the inmate is allowed out of the

  21   cell for an hour or two hours, or whatever the prescribed

  22   period of recreation is, he also is checked up on by staff,

  23   other staff, at least once a day, correct?

  24   A.  Oh, yes, sir.

  25   Q.  And if a person needs medical attention, there's usually a




                                                                8209


   1   medical staff who makes a daily round to each cell regardless

   2   whether they have asked for medical attention, correct?

   3   A.  That's correct.  There are a number of staff members who

   4   make rounds to these cells each day.

   5   Q.  So a medical staff person goes into that sallyport between

   6   a solid door and the grill each day, correct?

   7   A.  Escorted with another staff member, yes.

   8   Q.  And if a prisoner is on medication, then up to four times

   9   a day a physician's assistant may step into that sallyport

  10   between the solid door and the grill, correct?

  11   A.  Certainly possible, yes.

  12   Q.  And then if a person needs psychological counseling or

  13   evaluation, a person would step into that area between the

  14   grill and the solid door, correct?

  15   A.  That's correct.  Again, escorted by a corrections officer.

  16   Q.  And the person, the department head, a department head is
