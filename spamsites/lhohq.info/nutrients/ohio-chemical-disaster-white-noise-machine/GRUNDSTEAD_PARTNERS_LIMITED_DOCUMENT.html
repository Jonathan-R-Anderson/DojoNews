   4   issue in the preliminary instructions by not dealing with it.

   5            MR. RUHNKE:  Yes.

   6            THE COURT:  All right.  So those four items we know

   7   we have to address further with the aid of whatever input

   8   counsel will give us on the timetable we've indicated.

   9            Is there anything else with respect to the proposed

  10   preliminary instructions?

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Just one issue regarding language on

  12   page 7.  In the top paragraph which is one sentence the fourth

  13   line the government would suggest that the language be changed

  14   to say, lead a juror to conclude that the defendant should not

  15   receive the death penalty, instead of, be executed.

  16            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, it's getting a little bit

  17   euphemistic.  We're talking about execution, that's what we're

  18   talking about as the alternative to the sentence of life

  19   imprisonment.  It may be not nice to say it out loud, but

  20   that's what we're talking about.

  21            THE COURT:  I think that's the only time we use that

  22   language.  Anything else?  Anybody else?

  23            MR. BAUGH:  Did the Court just rule on the

  24   government's suggestion?

  25            THE COURT:  I think we should have consistent




                                                                6532


   1   language and I think, yes, I'm adopting the government's

   2   suggestion.

   3            Any other comment with respect to the Court's

   4   proposed preliminary instruction?

   5            MR. BAUGH:  There is one very small issue, your

   6   Honor, on page 5.  Future dangerousness we were talking about

   7   this morning the first sentence is, the defendant is likely to

   8   commit --

   9            THE COURT:  We're going to have a revision of that,

  10   right?

  11            MR. GARCIA:  Yes.

  12            THE COURT:  I mean that's why we dealt earlier in the

  13   day.

  14            MR. BAUGH:  The word likely.

  15            THE COURT:  The government is going to submit a

  16   revised list of aggravators and defendants are going to submit

  17   a revised list of mitigators.

  18            All right.  I think we're finished for the day.

  19            MR. RUHNKE:  I think so, your Honor, yes.

  20            THE COURT:  Except that we all wish the juror with

  21   the toothache a speedy recovery.  Okay, thank you.

  22            You've given me telephone numbers.  If we cannot the

  23   sit tomorrow we'll try and get word out to you as soon as we

  24   know that that's the case.

  25            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, as one of the lawyers who is




                                                                6533


   1   closest to the courtroom, would you like me to be here early?

   2   I'll take the responsibility for calling my co-counsel.

   3            THE COURT:  Fine.  Be here at 9:30.  That will be

   4   fine.

   5            MR. BAUGH:  Do you want me here before that?

   6            THE COURT:  In the past the jurors have been getting

   7   here about ten minutes after 9.

   8            MR. RUHNKE:  I just noted in the past when we had a

   9   juror who was sick there was apparently a mechanism for

  10   contacting the Marshals to tell them they were not going to be

  11   able to come.

  12            THE COURT:  To contact the other jurors?

  13            MR. RUHNKE:  I don't know if there is such a

  14   mechanism.

  15            THE COURT:  I'll leave that to the Marshals.  The

  16   other thing that I've been thinking about is whether we should

  17   contact the alternates and give them some clue that their

  18   lives must be very much in limbo, and I suppose the clue --

  19   let's think about that at the close of business tomorrow.  All

  20   right.  Thank you all.

  21            (Adjourned to 9:30 a.m., Thursday, May 24, 2000)
