  11            THE COURT:  We have agreed that the substance is that

  12   the verdict is life imprisonment, and I don't know whether the

  13   difference that you make is a public relations difference, a

  14   difference with respect to the next jury phase, what --

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  Two points, Judge.

  16            THE COURT:  Yes.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  The courts talk about an interest in

  18   finality.  Two things.  If the jury is deadlocked, I think we

  19   should have a note indicating they are deadlocked and an

  20   opportunity to have an Allen charge given, trying to reach a

  21   verdict in good conscience.  Number one.  Number two, it is

  22   not good public relations for us to get a right answer.  I

  23   think the jury is entitled to know if it is life imprisonment,

  24   but more important we need to know whether there is a

  25   deadlock, which could be an intellectual question, that there




                                                                7311


   1   is a problem here.

   2            These three choices on the verdict form assume a

   3   unanimous decision has been reached.  If you cannot reach a

   4   unanimous decision, you are to let us know by note and the

   5   parties and the court can proceed from there.  But I don't

   6   think we should assume that they are deadlocked or take

   7   deadlocked as being unanimously against the death penalty.  I

   8   think we need to qualify whatever language is used by count in

   9   the unlikely event that there is a split by count.

  10            (Pause)

  11            THE COURT:  Let me read it again:  Ladies and

  12   gentlemen of the jury.  The charge correctly informs you, page

  13   28, line 1, that if you do not unanimously find beyond a

  14   reasonable doubt that the death sentence should be imposed,

  15   you should indicate this in section V of the special verdict

  16   form.  Let me elaborate on how this is done.  If the jury has

  17   not unanimously found that death is the appropriate sentence,

  18   then the government has failed to prove that death is

  19   appropriate to your unanimous satisfaction.  If this is the

  20   case, then your verdict is that Al-'Owhali should be sentenced

  21   to life imprisonment and you should check the first box on

  22   page 15.  This is because the consequence of a lack of

  23   unanimity in favor of death is a verdict in favor of life

  24   imprisonment.  Before you reach any conclusion based on a lack

  25   of unanimity in favor of a death sentence, you should continue




                                                                7312


   1   your discussions until you are fully satisfied that further

   2   discussion will not yield a unanimous verdict in favor of

   3   death.  Again, you are to consider this separately as to each

   4   count listed in the special verdict form.

   5            MR. COHN:  I need a minute, Judge.

   6            THE COURT:  Yes.

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  It might save time since I won't

   8   need a minute to say that we object on the grounds of 3593(e).

   9   It says that the jury by unanimous vote shall recommend

  10   whether the defendant should be sentenced to death, to life

  11   imprisonment without possibility of release, or some other

  12   lesser sentence, and the latter part does not apply.  A

  13   deadlock is not a verdict and I think we shouldn't tell the

  14   jury that it is a verdict.  The jury either agrees unanimously

  15   that death is appropriate, they agree unanimously that life is

  16   appropriate, or they deadlock.  The consequence of a deadlock

  17   may be a life sentence but that is not a verdict.

  18            THE COURT:  When you say may be --

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  The consequence is, but it is not a

  20   verdict.

  21            THE COURT:  We are all in agreement if this jury is

  22   deadlocked it is a life sentence.  Shouldn't fairness indicate

  23   that they know that, so that the jurors may turn to one juror

  24   and say, you know, that's what is going to happen, if you

  25   don't vote in favor of death, then you understand that will




                                                                7313


   1   override the 11.  Not it is going to go before some other

   2   jury, not that the judge is going to make some independent

   3   decision.  We are all in agreement that that is what happens,

   4   and what we are debating now is whether the jury should be

   5   told that is what will happen.

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  But if they are told that, assuming

   7   we should tell them that, my only point is that we should tell

   8   them that a failure to agree upon on a verdict is not a

   9   verdict.  The consequence will be that this is not presented

  10   to another jury --

  11            THE COURT:  What is the difference between it not

  12   being a verdict and something which definitively indicates to

  13   the court what is to be in the judgment?

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  I think it comes from Jones, where

  15   it says the government, particularly in a capital proceeding,

  16   has a very serious interest in the finality of having a

  17   verdict, a consensus as the conscience of the community.

  18   There is an interest in both sides to having 12 people be

  19   unanimous one way or the other, and for a verdict to be

  20   reached where 12 people say death versus life has a greater

  21   effect for the process than some split which may result --
