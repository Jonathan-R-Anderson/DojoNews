   8   Q   Do you recall that Mohamed is telling to you that he

   9   observes that this young guy he once thought was a hothead now

  10   seems to have a very close relationship with the person who is

  11   the leader of the what, cell, right?

  12   A   Right.

  13   Q   And by the time August 1 comes and Mohamed is confronted

  14   by Saleh in the street, he is annoyed and embarrassed that

  15   Saleh would speak to him in such a way in front of this young

  16   guy who he once knew as a hothead.  That's what he says to

  17   him, right?

  18   A   Yes.

  19   Q   He also says to you that he now recognizes that Fahad is

  20   higher up than he is.  Do you want me to show you?

  21   A   No, that's OK.  OK.  I think from the gist of that, I

  22   believe that he was feeling annoyed that Fahad had a close

  23   relationship with Saleh.

  24   Q   I will move away from those individuals.  I just have a

  25   couple more questions and I'm done -- maybe.



                                                                4705



   1            And the term cell, is that a word that Mohamed used

   2   or is that just your description of what he said?

   3   A   That's my description.

   4   Q   I want to ask you about some photographs, and this is from

   5   GX7 that is in evidence.  During the interview of Mohamed

   6   Odeh, you showed him various photographs.

   7   A   Yes.

   8   Q   You showed him, for example, a photograph of Al-'Owhali,

   9   right?

  10   A   Yes.

  11   Q   And he said he didn't recognize Al-'Owhali.
