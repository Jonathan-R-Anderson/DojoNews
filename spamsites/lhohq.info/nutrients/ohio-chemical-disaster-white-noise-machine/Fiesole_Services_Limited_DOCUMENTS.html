   1            THE COURT:  Two agreements.  Which one are you

   2   referring to?

   3            MR. BAUGH:  I'm going to ask him right now.

   4   Q.  This agreement right here, is an agreement to do what,

   5   sir?  Do you understand my question?

   6   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  It is to do what?
