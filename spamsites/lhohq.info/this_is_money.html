<meta name="description" content="Foundations for Globally Managing Extraterrestrial Affairs – The Legacy
of the Nazi Germany-Extraterrestrial Connection
Introduction [1] :
There is compelling evidence that in the early 1930’s, the technology and presence of one
or more extraterrestrial (ET) races became known to the leaders of Nazi Germany who
embarked on an ambitious effort to communicate with these races for the purpose of
acquiring their advanced technology. Using communication techniques that would be
widely dismissed today as ‘psychic channeling’, there is evidence that the Nazi sponsorshipof occult societies that specialized in this form of communication with these ET races, was
successful in gaining information that produced rapid technological breakthroughs that
eventually came to the attention of the intelligence services of Britain, France, USSR and
the USA. While predictably dismissive of such esoteric practices by the Nazi regime, each
of the intelligence services of these major states initiated efforts to attain whatever
intelligence information they could gain on the purported Nazi communication methods
with an ET race(s) while monitoring the ‘ET inspired’ technology being developed by Nazi
Germany.
At a time of growing international tension where another major European war (World War
2) loomed on the horizon, major global powers would have been concerned about the
ramifications of Nazi Germany seeking to acquire advanced technology through esoteric
forms of communication with ET races. While sightings of ET/UFO craft were relatively
rare in the 1930’s, historically there had been sufficient sightings to raise the possibility of
an ET presence on the planet for political leaders. [2] Not only was Nazi Germany actively
developing technology that was inspired through such communication, but it had also
learned of remote locations around the planet where it could retrieve ET artifacts. The Nazis
sponsored numerous expeditions to remote locations the results of which were largely
unknown to Western intelligence services. [3] There is also evidence that Nazi Germany
was able to eventually retrieve an operational ‘ET craft’, which suggested the Nazis were
being assisted by one or more ET races. [4]
In this paper I analyze how global management of what can be defined as ‘Extraterrestrial
Affairs’ – government policies dealing with the existence of ET races and ET inspired
technology - has as its foundations events that occurred during the 1930’s when ET’s first
began to communicate with the leadership of a major world government. The fact that this
government was that of Nazi Germany who soon began a campaign aiming to establish
military dominance in Europe, was significant in terms of how the ET presence would later
be globally managed by the victorious Allied powers who emerged from the carnage of the
Second World War. I begin by analyzing Nazi Germany’s ‘success’ in communicating with
ET races and gaining information for the development of ET inspired technology that
would be used to build offensive weapons for the Nazi war effort. I will argue that the
‘successful’ conclusion of the Second World War led to a rude awakening on the part of
the Allied powers of the full ramifications of the Nazi successes in developing ET
technology. Not only had Nazi Germany successfully developed and/or reverse engineered
ET technology through questionable psychic channeling methods, discovery of ET artifacts
and retrieval of ET craft, but a significant number of the Nazi elite had escaped with the
most advanced of their ET inspired technology to hidden locations in Antarctica and South
America. This meant that contrary to public perceptions of a successful conclusion to the
Second World War, a significant portion of Nazi Germany’s most advanced technological
assets and military-scientific elite was outside the reach of the victorious Allied powers.What compounded the serious policy dilemma confronting the Allied Powers with the
continuation of remnants of the Nazi regime in Antarctica and South America was the
physical intervention of ET races that seriously impacted on the need to manage the ET
presence globally. Even more disturbing was the possibility that the elite remnants of the
Nazi regime was being assisted by one or more ET races thereby making it impossible for a
complete eradication of the Nazi presence. What follows is an effort to identify the main
policies used by major states to globally manage the acquisition and development of ET
technology, respond to the ET presence, and deal with the policy consequences of Nazi
elites hidden in secret bases in the Antarctic and South America.
Nazi Germany’s Pre-War Programs to Develop ET Inspired Technology
Adolph Hitler’s fascination with Occult Sciences, Esoteric philosophies and exotic
technologies led him to exploiting whatever avenues he had in gaining access to and
developing weapons technologies that would allow Nazi Germany to gain its rightful place,
in Hitler’s view, as a leading global power. [5] As a student of occult sciences, Hitler was
well aware of the possibility of communicating with extraterrestrial races through methods
such as ‘psychic channeling’ whereby an individual could establish communication with
non-physical and/or distant life forms and transmit information. Such communication was
well known among the Occult societies scattered throughout Northern Europe who studied
the work of mystics such as Helena Blavatsky, who wrote extensively of her esoteric
communications with other ‘life forms’ and how to develop these communication abilities.
[6]
While such a phenomenon in the contemporary era struggles to be taken seriously by the
general public, there is compelling evidence that not only did Hitler take it seriously, but
devoted considerable resources of the Nazi state into converting information gained from
such efforts into technology development and weapons production. [7] Much of the
information gained in such ‘psychic communications’ led to Nazi expeditions in the period
before the Second World War to remote locations such as Tibet, Antarctica, South America,
Iraq and elsewhere in search of buried ET artifacts from earlier civilizations.
One of the principal Nazi Occult societies that were supported by Hitler was the Vril
Society that “was allegedly ‘channeling’ messages from an alien civilization in the
Aldebaran solar system and planned to develop a craft that could make physical contact
with the civilization there.” [8] Another significant Occult Group was the Thule Society
that was similarly claiming to be in communication with an advanced race; rather than an
off-world ET race, however, this was an advanced human race with Nordic features from
an ancient Earth civilization that inhabited subterranean territories that were accessible from
the polar regions and other secluded areas around the planet. [9]
The seriousness and support given by Hitler to such communications is evidenced by the
material support given to these Occult societies in terms of scientific resources fordeveloping their ‘ET inspired’ technologies. By 1934, for example, “the Vril Society had
apparently developed its first UFO shaped aircraft, known as the Vril 1, which was
propelled by an anti-gravity effect.” [10] While there was predictable skepticism by more
traditional branches of the German military of the viability of such ‘channeled’ information,
the Nazi SS were at the forefront of efforts to develop this technology. Later in the Second
World War, the Nazi SS would take over complete control of Hitler’s
‘scientific-military-occult complex’ ensuring the highest level of secrecy in developing and
operationalising ET inspired technology.
An important insight into Hitler was that he viewed such technologies as part of a ‘natural
order’ he wished to establish as revealed in an interview he had in 1934 with the son of a
German scientist, Viktor Schauberger who, was a pioneer in aviation technology based on
anti-gravity propulsion:
In June of 1934 my father was invited by the Reich’s Chancellor Adolph
Hitler to discuss his work. Hitler wanted to know about his discoveries and
talk about the various possibilities and what his great plan was. And he said
‘yes, I’m looking for a new technology that must once again harmonize with
the natural order of things and that is my real program. [11]
Hitler gave powerful material support to Schauberger suggesting the pattern by which
technologies, which harmonized with Hitler’s occult/naturalistic worldviews, would be
supported:
Schauberger was given a team of scientists to help him with his work ... they
perfected the ‘flying disc’ powered by Schauberger’s turbine which rotated air
into a twisting type of oscillation resulting in the build-up of immense power
causing levitation [anti-gravity propulsion]. Schauberger’s prototype was then
developed into a vehicle known as the Belluzzo-Schriever-Miethe Diskus, a
machine built up to 22ft in diameter. These craft traveled at over 2000 km/hr
and were planned to go over 4,000 km/hr. By 1945 they could reach 1300
mph and gain an altitude of 40,000 feet in less than three minutes. The craft
was also noted to glow blue-green as it rose and left a silvery glow. [12]
A number of US intelligence sources testified that Nazi Germany had indeed developed
technology that resembled modern day UFO’s. According to Virgil Armstrong, a former
CIA agent:
We know that in the early parts of the war there were certain factions of the
Allied forces that did not believe he [Hitler] had a secret weapon and it wasn’t
until the Americans made much emphasis of this that they began to look at it
seriously and indeed did discover that Hitler not only had a secret weapon, he
had what we would call today a UFO or spacecraft. [13]Another prominent US military official who testified about the Nazi supported technologies
was Captain Ed Ruppelt, who was the initial Chief Investigator for US Air Force Project
Bluebook: 'When WWII ended, the Germans had several radical types of aircraft and
guided missiles under development. The majority were in the most preliminary stages, but
they were the only known craft that could even approach the performance of objects
reported to UFO observers...' [14] Astronaut Edgar Mitchell also confirmed in 1991 that
much of the ET cover up dated from the Second World War. [15]
There have also been reports that Nazi Germany had retrieved a ‘crashed’ ET craft. [16]
Colonel Phillip Corso, who was a senior officer in charge of reverse engineering ET
technology during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, gave support to such an
event in an interview:
There were crashes elsewhere, and they [the Germans] gathered material too.
The Germans were working on it. They didn’t solve the propulsion system.
They did a lot of experiments on flying saucers. They had one that went up to
12,000 feet. But where all, we and they, missed out was on the guidance
system. In R&D we began to realize that this being [an ET] was part of the
guidance system, part of the apparatus himself, or itself, as it had no sexual
organs.' [17]
If such a crash had indeed occurred, on top of whatever information was gained from the
Nazi Occult Societies communication with ET races, then this would have considerably
boosted Nazi Germany’s efforts to develop ET technology for a campaign of military
conquest in Europe.
It is very likely that at some stage in the time before the onset of the Second World War in
1939, military intelligence officials from the Western democracies and the Soviet Union
guessed that from the available evidence - intelligence assessments of Nazi sponsored
occult societies, Hitler’s support of esoteric philosophies and practices, fully funded Nazi
expeditions to remote locations around the planet, and the technological innovations
supported in Nazi scientific laboratories - that Nazi Germany was serious in developing
technology that Hitler and his senior officials gained from occult communications with
ET’s.
The scientific cultural traditions of both the Western democracies, based on ‘scientific
rationalism’ developed in the European Age of Enlightenment; and of the Soviet Union
where a Marxist Historical Materialism was dominant, would have led to the military
intelligence communities of the Western democracies and the Soviet Union, dismissing the
relevance of Hitler’s occult communications. Nevertheless, the fact that Hitler was actively
supporting such communications with the scientific assets of the Nazi state would have
warranted close monitoring of the situation. As more information on the UFO presence
emerged in the later 1930’s, there would predictably have concern by Western and Sovietintelligence services that Hitler’s occult communications with ET’s might give Nazi
Germany an important military advantage in any future war.
More disturbing from the perspective of Western intelligence sources was the possibility
that Nazi Germany was tacitly being given assistance from an ET race in these
communications despite Hitler’s militaristic policies in Europe. That Nazi Germany
received assistance from ET’s was suggested by the father of modern rocketry, Hermann
Oberth who confirmed a Nazi-ET connection when he stated, 'we cannot take credit for our
record advancement in certain scientific fields alone. We have been helped.' When asked by
whom, he replied, 'the peoples of other worlds.' [18] The likelihood that Nazi Germany
had come into possession of a ‘crashed’ ET craft may have been evidence of some form of
tacit assistance given to Nazi Germany by one or more ET races.
From the perspective of an ET race communicating and even visiting the Earth in the
1930’s, Nazi Germany would have been a logical choice for such ‘assistance’. Hitler’s
receptiveness to esoteric practices and technologies meant that such an ET race had a means
of communicating with a major world power at a time when other governments would have
been suspicious of the policies of visiting ET races and of opening up unfamiliar channels
of communication with one or more of them. The idea of establishing communication
through esoteric practices such as ‘psychic channeling’, would have been dismissed as
ludicrous or even dangerous by Western and Soviet policy makers who were still
attempting to discover as much as they could about the ET presence through more
conventional military intelligence sources and scientific methods. Much later, the US and
other Allied states developed their own protocols and standards for establishing
communication with ET nations through similar psychic channeling techniques pioneered
by the Nazi Occult societies. Former Air force Sergeant, Dan Sherman, revealed his own
training in telepathic/psychic communication by the National Security Agency, which is the
premier US organization for communicating with ET races. [19]
In giving whatever limited assistance it could to Nazi Germany, assuming protocols exist
for advanced races communicating with the governments of worlds not yet possessing a
unified global government, ET races in communication with Nazi authorities possibly
received benefits in return that would have been a cause for concern by the future Allied
powers. The possibilities of a tacit alliance between Nazi Germany and an ET race, even if
this only went as far Nazis using psychics to communicate with such a race, would
certainly have given rise to an important question by the future Allied powers. Would Hitler
risk the best interest of global humanity in exchange for what would facilitate Germany’s
re-emergence as a major world power? [20] They most likely answered yes and played for
time in deciding how to deal with Hitler aggressive nationalist policies; the technology
developed by Hitler’s ‘military-scientific-occult’ complex; and to the nature of the ‘threat’,
if any, posed by the ET presence to human sovereignty on the planet.
The possibility of Nazi success in developing some form of communication with an ETrace and even having direct access to ET technology would have contributed to the
eagerness of Britain to accommodate Germany’s concerns in redressing inequities from the
Versailles Peace Agreement. Any political and diplomatic dialogue to address these, even if
these upset Britain’s main European ally, France, would give Britain much needed time to
gauge the security threat posed by Hitler’s regime and his exotic weapons acquisition
programs. The Munich agreement struck between the British Prime Minister, Neville
Chamberlain, and Hitler in resolving the 1938 crisis over German populated areas of
Czechoslovakia, meant Czechoslovakia lost territory and its important defense assets. From
the perspective of Britain and France, such a strategic gamble was necessary if indeed Nazi
Germany’s were to be persuaded that it could benefit greatly if it choose to cooperate with
the West in responsibly dealing with the ET presence and technology.
Cooperation with the West in terms of financial support and investment from Western
corporations had already provided the bulk of Nazi Germany’s re-industrialization efforts.
Major US and British corporations invested heavily in Nazi German industries and
established important relationships with senior Nazi leaders. [21] Rather than merely being
a temporary phenomenon made possibly by the brief period when major Western states
such as Britain and the US had considerable sympathy for the Nazi’s efforts for removing
the inequities of the Versailles Peace Treaty, [22] there is compelling evidence that such
relationships continued even during the war period itself. The Rockefeller controlled
Standard Oil Co., for example, had extensive dealings with the German petrochemical giant
I.G. Farben in oil and chemical sectors, and their relationship continued even after the US
entered the war in December 1941. In May 1942, criminal charges were initially brought
against Standard Oil executives and later dropped, but its deals with I.G. Farben became
subject to a Senate Special Committee Investigating the National Defense Program chaired
by Harry Truman. [23]
The Second World War, the Nazi-ET Connection and the Covert Nazi Exodus
The 1939 deal struck between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to divide Poland
between them was the action that triggered the Second World War. For Britain and France,
it meant that Nazi Germany was fixed on a campaign of European domination regardless of
any political concessions made by the former for the sake of peace in Europe. If it were true
that Germany had indeed received tacit assistance from an ET race and/or had acquired ET
inspired technology, Germany’s invasion of Poland had profound implications. This meant
that Germany would have to be quickly defeated before it could fully operationalize
whatever ET inspired technology or information it had in its possession for offensive
weaponry. Nothing was spared in the main war objective of defeating the Axis powers
who constituted a long term threat not only for European democracies, but for the
sovereignty of global humanity vis-à-vis one or more ET races tacitly assisting Nazi
Germany. Winston Churchill, the British Conservative Prime Minister, rebuffed all efforts
to strike a peace deal with Nazi Germany despite the generous terms offered by Hitler. [24]After the rapid military defeat of France in 1940, this meant that Britain was desperate in
ensuring that the US entered the war as soon as possible to assist in the defeat of Germany.
While this would undoubtedly have been a logical policy for Britain or any nation engaged
in a desperate military struggle with a formidable military opponent, the nature of
Germany’s technological programs and the likely ET connection required immediate action
by major non-belligerents such as the US. In the early stages of the War, President
Roosevelt, was informed of the ET presence and the likelihood that Nazi Germany was
rapidly developing offensive weapons based on ET technology and assistance. According
to Dr Michael Wolf, who claims to have been a member of the secret National Security
Council body that oversees ET affairs in the US, 'The first UFO came down in 1941 into
the ocean west of San Diego, and was retrieved by the Navy.' [25] Another date for this
discovery given by the now deceased Colonel William Brophy was Feb 25, 1942. [26]
None of these justifications for entering the war, however, could be revealed to the general
public or the US Congress. This made necessary an alternative course of action by US
policy makers. It is very likely that President Roosevelt and the British Prime Minister,
Winston Churchill, contrived political events in the Pacific so that it would be inevitable that
Imperial Japan would attack the American Pacific Fleet based at Pearl Harbor. [27] Such a
contrivance would have been necessary given that Hitler had taken all the steps he could in
ensuring that the US would not enter the war on the side of Britain. [28] Essentially, there
was no way of persuading the American public of the need to side with Britain when Nazi
Germany was clearly avoiding its error from the First World War when its unrestricted
submarine warfare brought the US into the war.
Evidence of the US recovering a downed ET craft in 1941/42, may have been a means of
ET’s leveling the playing field in terms of providing similar ET technologies to the
respective sides in the World War. Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was
testimony to Hitler’s confidence that his secret weapons technology programs would be
successful in producing the offensive weapons required for Nazi victories in Europe.
At the end of the war, the superiority of Nazi Germany’s technology was starkly revealed
by correspondence between Major General Hugh Knerr, Deputy Commanding General for
Administration of US Strategic Forces in Europe, and Lieutenant General Carl Spatz in
March 1945:
Occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the
fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research, if we
do not take this opportunity to seize apparatus and the brains that developed it
and put this combination back to work promptly, we will remain several years
behind while we attempt to cover a field already exploited. [29]
This suggests that the years Nazi Germany had in developing ET inspired technologies
while the Allied powers were skeptical of the communication techniques used by the Nazi’s
sponsorship of occult societies were crucial. After it became known that Nazi Germany’soffensive weapons capabilities were derived from its communications with ET races and
likely recovery of ET technology; Britain, the US and even the Soviet Union, were already
far behind the technological discoveries made by the Nazis. Even the discovery and
retrieval of ET craft by the US in 1941/42, would not have enabled the Allies to bridge the
technological gap with Nazi Germany.
The Nazi Retreat to Antarctica, ‘Operation High Jump’, and ET Assistance
The ‘official’ defeat of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945 was in fact a ‘tactical
victory’ that masked a major strategic defeat for the ‘victorious Allies’ that was kept from
the general public. A significant proportion of Nazi Germany’s political elite, their most
advanced ET technology and fully operational ‘saucer ships’ had escaped from Allied
occupation forces. [30] What remained of Nazi Germany’s advanced weapons programs
was disturbing enough in terms of the overall technological advances achieved by the Nazis
in many fields of weapons production. [31] The fact that the Nazis had removed their most
advanced secrets, technology and personnel during the run up to the final defeat of
Germany would have been a huge shock to Allied leaders once it became clear what had
occurred. [32] Rather than the final months of the Second World War being a last desperate
gamble by a megalomaniac Nazi leadership that could not accept inevitable defeat, it was in
fact a holding action for a methodically well planned extraction of the Nazi’s most valuable
resources and personnel to well prepared remote locations in the Antarctic and South
America. This allowed the Nazis to continue their unique social system, and plan to
eventually play an important, if not dominant, role in global affairs.
The Nazis had sufficient time and resources to prepare for such an exodus given their
extensive business links, front companies, and connections with South American
governments and companies. The well equipped and led Nazi expeditions to the Antarctic
in the pre-war period allowed the Nazi’s to familiarize themselves with the Antarctic terrain
and lay the foundations for any post-war role to be played by these territories. The most
ambitious Nazi expedition occurred in 1938 when extensive portions of the Antarctic were
claimed by Captain Alfred Ritscher on behalf of the Nazi government. The aircraft carrier,
Schwabenland, sent planes to perform extensive aerial surveillance of the region claimed by
Nazi Germany, which was called Neuschwabenland. [33] During the war itself, extensive
submarine activity in the region of Antarctica suggested that Nazis could have been
building bases. Such a possibility was fueled by a comment made by the commander of
Nazi Germany’s submarine fleet, Admiral Karl Donitz in 1943, when he claimed that his
fleet had built “in another part of the world a Shangri-La land – an impregnable fortress.”
[34] After Germany’s unconditional surrender on May 8, 1945, Nazi submarine activity in
the Antarctic region continued as evidenced by the following report by the Agence France
Press on September 25, 1946: “the continuous rumors about German U-boat activity in the
region of Tierra del Fuego [‘Feuerland’ in German] between the southernmost tip of Latin
America and the continent of Antarctica are based on true happenings.” [35]What compounded this realization of a Nazi elite exodus to Antarctica for the Allies was the
now irrefutable evidence that ET races were indeed visiting the Earth. The ET presence
would now be a factor in the Allies pursuing and eradicating the remnants of Nazi
Germany that had relocated to Antarctica and South America, and who were now using
their fully operational ‘saucer ships’ to move around the planet and to even fly into deep
space. Many of the UFOs witnessed in the immediate post war era were according to
reports from a number of military officials aware of the advanced nature of the Nazi’s
technology, were fully operational Nazi space craft. [36]
A little known effort to once and for all end the Nazi threat occurred with a Naval military
expedition led by Admiral Richard Byrd to the Antarctic in 1946/47. Byrd’s military
expedition was named “Operation High Jump,” and comprised “4700 military personnel,
six helicopters, six Martin PBM flying boats, two seaplane tenders, fifteen other aircraft,
thirteen US Navy support ships and one aircraft carrier; the USS Philippine Sea (left).”
[37] Among the commands issued to Admiral Byrd from the Commander of the US Navy,
Admiral Chester Nimitz were: “(b) to consolidate and extend American sovereignty over
the largest practical area of the Antarctic continent; (c) to determine the feasibility of
establishing and maintaining bases in the Antarctic and to investigate possible base sites”
[38] Ironically, it was Admiral Byrd who had earlier addressed Captain Ritscher’s Nazi
expedition before it departed for Antarctica back in 1938/39. Now Admiral Byrd was
leading a US Naval Expedition to seek out and eliminate the Nazi elite who escaped to
bases created or ‘discovered’ during the Schwabenland expedition.
The Antarctic summer of 1946/47 was the first opportunity to mount such a large military
expedition to the frigid regions of Antarctica. Coming so soon after the end of the Second
World War, it was a puzzle why such a large armada would travel to Antarctica at a time of
increasing Cold War tension and decommissioning of Naval personnel, unless the
expedition was sent to militarily deal with some unresolved issues from the War itself –
remnants of the Nazi elite hidden in an underground base or bases established or
‘discovered’ in the pre-war era. Hitler had authorized a number of military missions to the
Antarctic in the pre-war era making it possible that one or more underground bases had
been established or discovered. [39] The Byrd mission was scheduled to last up to six
months but ended in a mere eight weeks because it had, according to Chilean Press reports,
“run into trouble' and that there had been 'many fatalities'. [40] If the true goal of the
mission was to locate and eradicate any Nazi bases, the press reports and early end to the
mission indicated dismal failure and a rude awakening for the US Navy.
A March 5, 1947 Chilean press interview of Admiral Byrd, after the premature end of
Operation High Jump, suggested that there had indeed been a military failure and there was
a new threat located at the South Pole:
Adm. Byrd declared today that it was imperative for the United States toinitiate immediate defense measures against hostile regions. The Admiral
further stated that he didn’t want to frighten anyone unduly but it was a bitter
reality that in case of a new war the continental United States would be
attacked by flying objects which could fly from pole to pole at incredible
speeds. [41]
It was clear that the best the US Navy could muster was no match for the small but well
armed Nazi elite that survived the war in their remote Antarctic location. Again, the
possibility that the Nazi’s were receiving ET assistance in fending off the US attack could
not be discounted. The Nazis efforts through occult groups such as the Thule Society to
communicate with an advanced subterranean humanoid civilization, ‘Thule’, may have
resulted in the elite Nazis being assisted in relocating to the hidden Antarctic base and
possibly receiving significant ET support from any attack by the US and its allies.
A little known expedition of Admiral Byrd to the North Pole at the same time of Operation
High Jump where he supposedly came into contact with an advanced subterranean race
with Nordic physical characteristics suggests that the Thule Society had indeed been correct
in its assessment of the existence of such a race. Admiral Byrd disclosed the circumstances
of this encounter in a posthumously published entry in his diary where the leader of this
advanced subterranean race greeted him:
'We have let you enter here because you are of noble character and well-known
on the Surface World, Admiral' ... you are in the domain of the Arianni, the
Inner World of the Earth.... Admiral, I shall tell you why you have been
summoned here. Our interest rightly begins just after your race exploded the
first atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. It was at that
alarming time we sent our flying machines, the 'Flugelrads', to your surface
world to investigate what your race had done.... You see, we have never
interfered before in your race's wars, and barbarity, but now we must, for you
have learned to tamper with a certain power that is not for man, namely, that of
atomic energy. Our emissaries have already delivered messages to the powers
of your world, and yet they do not heed. Now you have been chosen to be
witness here that our world does exist. You see, our Culture and Science is
many thousands of years beyond your race, Admiral.' [42]
The veracity of Byrd’s dairy continues to be debated but Byrd’s comments to the Chilean
Press suggests he was sufficiently unnerved by events related to his polar expedition(s) in
1946/47 for such an encounter to have occurred. Subsequent reports of extensive UFO
activity in the Antarctic region were confirmation that Antarctic was being used as a base of
operations for the new enemy that so unnerved Admiral Byrd – either Nazi Germany
and/or one or more ET races. [43]
Foundations for Global Management of Extraterrestrial Affairs
The ‘victorious’ Allied powers (who called themselves the United Nations which alsobecame the official name of the new international organization to replace the League of
Nations in 1945) formed the foundations of a post-World War II order in response to
events that had preceded and occurred during the War. The most important event aside from
the visitation of ET races themselves was the rapid technological advances achieved by
Nazi Germany’s scientists as a result of sponsoring esoteric communication techniques
with ET races. The primary lessons learned from the Nazi-ET connection were the
following.
ET races were visiting the Earth and eager to establish ongoing communications with
the political leaderships of major national governments.
Psychic communication techniques with ET races played a significant role in Nazi
Germany’s rapid technological advancements.
ET artifacts dating from antiquity could be found in remote locations around the
planet, and had a potential for rapid technological advances by their discoverers.
One or more ET races tacitly supported Nazi Germany’s weapons acquisition
programs.
ET races would not direct intervene in violent national conflicts and appeared to play
an even handed role in assisting belligerent states to develop ET technologies for
either offensive or defensive purposes.
Nazi Germany’s elites survived the war in remote locations in Antarctica and South
America and would play a continued role in regional/world affairs.
The foundations for globally managing ET affairs after the Second World War were a
number of policies based on the lessons learned from the Second World War era. There is
considerable evidence to suggest that the major Allied powers of the US, USSR, Britain,
and France have ‘cooperated’ in observing and implementing these global management
policies despite powerful rivalries and diverging interests. Much of the cooperation
between the US and the USSR, was due to the shared perception of the need to cooperate
in dealing with the ET presence and the continued Nazi bases, and the profound lessons
learned from Nazi experience when a major state embarked on military adventurism based
on its confidence that it could use ET technology for offensive purposes.
The most important factor which impinged on this global cooperation were clear ideological
differences between the Western and Soviet bloc nations which held antagonistic visions of
how to best organize society, and the planet. This meant that each bloc, respectively led by
the US and USSR, was simultaneously cooperating to effectively respond to the ET
presence and existence of Nazi bases, while competing to maximize their respective zones
of influence around the planet. The US and USSR took the lead in creating the political,
military and economic structures that each ideological bloc would use in dealing with its
own members, and with the rival bloc of nations. Each ideological bloc would deal with the
various policy issues emerging from the existence of ET races and technologies using the
structures it set up specifically for dealing with this issue. However, each bloc would
cooperate in coordinating policy on the ET presence through the regular summit meetingsbetween their political leaderships and the channels of communication established by each
bloc’s respective military and intelligence communities.
The eventual recognition of the Peoples Republic of China as a Permanent member of the
Security Council in 1972, signified its emergence as a major state that would also play a
significant role in globally managing ET affairs by asserting a regional zone of influence in
pursuing and acquiring ET technology and responding to the ET presence. There is little
evidence that the non-Aligned Group of nations that emerged in the 1960’s played a
significant role in globally managing the ET technology and the ET presence. Based on the
institutional structures, relationships, and cooperative agreements reached by the Allied
powers in dealing with ET technology and the ET presence around the planet, five main
policies adopted by the Allied powers for globally managing ET affairs can be identified.
1. Non-Disclosure of Extraterrestrial Affairs
The first major policy adopted for globally managing ET affairs was that this would not be
disclosed to the general publics and most elected officials of the major allied states until
some time in the future when the policy consequences of the ET presence and ET
technology could be clearly determined. In the case of the US, President Roosevelt adopted
the decision for non-disclosure and after the US confirmed the reality of the ET presence
and of ET technology. This was later institutionalized by the Truman and Eisenhower
administrations in a manner that would allow the non-disclosure to be continued for an
indefinite period. [44] Each of the Western democratic nations playing a prominent role in
the global management system set up to deal with ET affairs, would form their own
institutional structures responsible for coordinating ET policies and ensuring
non-disclosure. [45] Each of the national governments would give all ET related projects
and information a sufficiently high security classification to make it a federal/national crime
for military and intelligence officials to come forward to reveal their participation in projects
concerning the ET presence and technology. [46] This would be a highly effective means
for restricting public debate and media investigation of ET related issues as evidenced by
the continued media blackout of the ET presence. [47]
This success of the strategy of non-disclosure required strict enforcement of national
security laws, and pressure on other states not privy to all aspects of ET affairs, to turn over
any information, artifacts or technologies in their possession to one or more of the major
powers in accord to the spheres of influence initially set out at the February 1945 agreement
at Yalta between Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin. The Yalta
agreement is significant since it not only established spheres of influence for dealing with
the territories liberated by the Allies, but it was also likely to have sanctioned a
non-disclosure policy of the ET presence and the Nazi-ET connection. This suggested that
the Allied states would cooperate to ensure ET affairs would remain a national security
issue that would involve severe penalties for disclosure by public officials. In the case of
the Soviet bloc of nations, and later China, even more draconian national security laws wereset in place to ensure non-disclosure by even the most brave of public officials who was
aware of government/military projects concerning ET technology and the ET presence.
The national political leaderships of states not playing a prominent role in globally
managing ET affairs, were only sufficiently informed of the ET presence to delegate the
matter over to their respective national security bodies. It appears that in cases where ET
artifacts were discovered, ET craft landed or retrievals of craft occurred, and/or where ET
contact occurred, these would be dealt with through the national security organs of the state
that would cooperate with the major states that had influence over the host nation. Dr
Jamisson Neruda, who claims to be a defector from a clandestine organization embedded
within the National Security Agency organization that specializes in ET communication and
technology, describes the circumstances surrounding the retrieval of an ET piloted craft
discovered by his father who served in the Bolivian Army:
In 1956. My father discovered a damaged spacecraft in the jungles of Bolivia
during a hunting trip. It was a triangular vessel about seventy meters from
end-to-end, nearly equilateral. It included twenty-six crew. All dead.... My
father recovered a specific technology from the ship, and then contacted a
military official within the Bolivian government that was a trusted friend.
Initially, my father was interested in selling the craft to the Bolivian military,
but it quickly became a concern of the U.S. military -- specifically the SPL
[Special Projects Laboratory]. A director from the SPL met with my father,
ascertained the ship's location, and performed a complete salvage operation in
the span of three days. [48]
The secret global recovery system operating for countries in the US sphere of influence is
called ‘Project Pounce’. Colonel Steve Wilson, a former leader of this clandestine group of
specialists from different branches of the US military revealed the activities of this secret
Project in a series of interviews:
Project Pounce is an elite group of Air Force Black Berets and military
scientists who rush to the scene of any UFO crashes, cordon off the area,
retrieve the extraterrestrial spacecraft and any occupants, then 'sanitize' the
crash site back to its pre-crash appearance, and intimidate any outside
witnesses into silence. [49]
The victorious Allies that formed the United Nations, and whose principal members
became the permanent members of the UN Security Council, would cooperate in ensuring
non-disclosure of the ET presence to their respective general publics, and other national
governments. This suggested that the United Nations Security Council provided an
important forum for the permanent members to coordinate their respective national policies
on ET’s and, ensuring non-disclosure of the ET presence and/or discovery of ET
technology.2. Non-Disclosure of the ET-Nazi Connection and Countering Nazi Influence in South
America
The second major policy adopted for globally managing ET affairs was that the ET
connection with Nazi Germany, and the survival of the Nazi elite in remote locations in
Antarctica and South America would not be disclosed to the general public and most
elected public officials by those national governments aware of the Nazi exodus. This was
to ensure that there would be no reemergence of the Nazi ideology as the basis of new
national government anywhere in the world, and of Nazi elites capturing a major state for
promoting their Nazi belief systems. This posed considerable difficulties in South America
where many governments had strong pro-Nazi sentiments and had provided material
support and safe havens for the Axis powers. Countries such as Argentina, Paraguay,
Chile and Brazil were carefully watched due to strong pro-Nazi sympathies among political
elites, and potential for these states to be vehicles for the spread of Nazism/Fascism in the
South American continent. [50]
Indeed, much of the Cold War struggle that occurred throughout South America was an
effort to contain the spread of Nazism/Fascism and the need to reign in the influence of
Nazi enclaves that influenced governments in this continent. The fear was that South
America could one day become a vehicle for a renewed effort by the remaining Nazi elites
for regional, if not global, domination. The Cold War struggle in South America was a
covert means for the US and USSR to minimize the threat posed by the escaped Nazi elite,
by exhausting South American states in a series of political and economic crises. These
perennial crises would ensure that no South American state could ever achieve the kind of
economic potential that would enable it to develop the industrial capacity and technological
base that would provide the Nazi elite a vehicle for achieving a leadership role in regional
and/or world affairs. For example, the 2002 decision by the International Monetary Fund
not to provide additional funds to Argentina, led to an easily predictable economic
meltdown that resulted in the closing of banks, cut back in government services, and rapid
increase in unemployment. [51] Rather than this being a result of different macro-economic
philosophies by the Bush administration as compared to the Clinton administration, it may
be suspected that the real reason was to deny Argentina the resources with which it could
play a major political role in the region. The final result would be to deny an increase in the
power of Nazi elites who continue to exert a powerful behind the scenes influence over the
Argentine political system, and other states in South America. Significantly, the individual
in charge of Cold War strategy in Latin America during the Truman administration was
Nelson Rockefeller who was later secretly appointed by Eisenhower to take charge of ET
affairs, and was suspected for his pro-Nazi sympathies and business links. [52]
3. Repatriation of Nazi Scientists/technologies and continuing Nazi Sponsored Human
Projects
The third major policy adopted for globally managing ET affairs was that all ET inspired
technology left by Nazi Germany was divided between the victorious powers of the US,
Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in terms of who had possession of the technology orscientists in their respective zones of control in Occupied Germany and former Nazi
occupied territories. Each Allied state incorporated this technology into their respective
clandestine military efforts aimed at weapons development and intelligence acquisition.
Each of the major Allied states had its own version of ‘Operation Paperclip’ where the US
sponsored the removal of Nazi scientists to the US, even in cases where they had strong
pro-Nazi records thereby violating US immigration laws. [53] These efforts of recruiting
Nazi scientists were distinguished by the continuation of many Nazi sponsored projects in
the US and USSR.
The expatriation of former Nazi scientists was particularly important in a number of fields
where the Nazis used slave labor and/or unwilling human subjects in testing and
developing ET inspired technologies. The restrictions on such experiments in the US and
other democratic nations meant that these Nazi scientists had a wealth of experience that
could not be easily replicated in the US and elsewhere. Areas in particular which were of
interest to Western nations aware of the ET presence were genetic and mind control
experiments aimed at optimizing human performance in extreme conditions. These
experiments were secretly continued in the US and other former Allied states with the
purpose of bioengineering ‘super soldiers’ who could display the kind of genetic and
mental qualities for extremely high military performance in outer space. The testimonies of
former participants of these experiments suggest that many of these former Nazi sponsored
genetic and mind control programs were indeed used for producing ‘super soldiers’. [54]
One individual who claims to have been a participant of these genetic and mind control
experiments, Andy Pero, gave an interview revealing the background of these mind control
experiments he was involved in:
After WW2 many Nazi scientists were brought over to the US through our
own Intelligence community who formerly worked in mind control research in
the concentration camps. I believe they are a remnant of the Nazi party
working in conjunction with different branches of the US government and the
military. Much of my training and torture sessions were done right at the
University of Rochester, NY. They used to take me to a private room in the
attic or top floor of the library. The big lab where I had most of the
programming done to me was at the Rome National Air Base in Rome, NY. I
have also been used in the Montauk chair while at Camp Hero, Montauk, L.I.
and also in a chair in Atlanta, GA at Dobbins Air Force Base.... The trainers
would put me into a trance whereby I'd be told I could jump off a ladder of
minimal height. In my mind, I believed that I was only jumping off a footstool
or a short ledge. In actuality, I was progressively led to jump higher and higher
heights to the point of successfully jumping off buildings and even out of
planes without a parachute. When under mind control, I could do whatever I
was instructed to do as long as I believed them. I would do 200 or more push
ups in perfect form, sometimes as long as a half hour straight, or until I wastold to stop. I weight lifted 545 lbs. on a barbell and squats while attending
college and much more (500-1500 lb.) while I was under the mind control in
the training laboratory not far from Rochester, NY. [55]
Other areas of experimentation involved psychometric weapons development and
experiments working with time/dimensional travel. [56] A number of participants in these
highly secret projects sponsored by intelligence and military branches of government have
come forward to give testimony of these projects. Preston Nichols, claims to have been a
former director of one of these projects and has testified to the use of children, the homeless
and other unwilling human subjects in continuing these highly secret experiments. He
outlined the history of Montauk Project as follows:
Over the years, the Montauk researchers perfected their mind control
techniques and continued to delve further into the far reaches of human
potential. By developing the psychic abilities of different personnel, it
eventually got to the point where a psychic's thoughts could be amplified with
hardware, and illusions could be manifested both subjectively and objectively.
This included the virtual creation of matter. All of this was unparalleled in the
history of what we call 'ordinary human experience' but the people who ran
the Montauk Project were not about to stop. They would reach even further
into the realm of the extraordinary. Once it was discovered that a psychic could
manifest matter, it was observed that it could appear at different times,
depending on what the psychic was thinking. Thus, what would happen if a
psychic thought of a book but thought of it appearing yesterday? It was this
line of thinking and experimentation which led to the idea that one could bend
time itself. After years of empirical research, time portals were opened with
massive and outrageous experiments being conducted. [57]
The sponsorship of human performance enhancing experiments and mind control was
adopted by all major governments interested in the work of Nazi Scientists, future
requirements for humans in space conditions, and possible future conflict with ET races.
[58] These experiments continue today and remain among the most classified projects
developed by major states that globally manage the ET presence, ET technology and legacy
of Nazi Germany.
4. Managing Extraterrestrial Artifacts Found Around the Planet
The fourth major policy adopted for globally managing ET affairs was that all ET artifacts
found around the planet would be bought under the control of one or more of the
‘victorious powers’ of US, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. This meant that the
post-war division of the globe into different ‘spheres of influence’ agreed to at Yalta, meant
that most if not all ET technology would eventually find its way into the clandestine military
programs of the US, Britain, the Soviet Union and France, or at least be monitored by these
major states. With the emergence of China as a permanent UN member, this meant that ittoo was recognized as having a legitimate sphere of influence wherein it could work to
access, control and/monitor discovered ET artifacts. Maintaining the principle established at
Yalta in 1945 to carve up the planet into different spheres of influence would help ensure
that there would be no proliferation of ET inspired technology since a major power would
be recognized as having legitimacy to covertly intervene, control and/or monitor ET
artifacts. This would help minimize chances of a repeat of the Nazi experience where a
discontented regional power could use ET technology for weapons development and
embark on a program of regional military domination that would once again threaten peace
and stability in a region or the globe.
This fundamental principle of globally managing ET affairs was particularly important in
those parts of the planet where ancient civilizations existed and where ET artifacts were
likely to be hidden in inaccessible or yet to be discovered areas. Regions such Tibet, Egypt,
Iraq, Afghanistan, Indochina, South and Central America, and elsewhere were all highly
valued assets due to the potential ET artifacts possibly located in these countries and
regions. The global cooperation between the US and USSR, and other permanent members
of the UN Security Council members, in responding to the ET presence and gaining access
to ET artifacts, yielded to intense strategic competition for control of these territories and
their hidden treasures. The Cold War ideological conflict masked the very real struggle for
each major state to maximize its power in terms of the technological breakthroughs ET
artifacts would provide. There is evidence that the current war in Iraq is but the latest
example of a regional military conflict whose ultimate prize is ET artifacts that would
impact on the technological programs of the major states managing ET affairs around the
planet. [59] The split between NATO members France and Germany, with the US and
Britain over the legitimacy and timing of the military intervention in Iraq, suggested that a
fundamental realignment in managing ET affairs had occurred with France and Germany
siding with Russia and even China in wanting to restrain the US. This suggested that the
post-Second World War cooperation for managing ET affairs was under severe strain, and
that very real tensions lay underneath the polite language of international diplomacy. [60]
5. Cooperating to End the Nazi Threat
The fifth major policy adopted for globally managing ET technology and the ET presence
was that the major powers would cooperate in responding to the challenge posed both by
the remnants of Nazi Germany in their hidden military bases in Antarctica and South
America; and to the one or more ET races that had and continued to assist Nazi elites. This
cooperation by the major powers was marked by agreements to not disclose this
information to their respective general publics and most elected political officials. What
surely most troubled Allied officials was the success of the Nazi elites to develop fully
operational saucer craft that were propelled by antigravity generators and navigational
systems that still had not been successfully developed by the US and USSR as mentioned
by Col Corso in an interview reflecting his time in service (he retired from military service
in 1963). [61] This Nazi success occurred well before the Allied states were able to develop
their own fleets of saucer ships.According to Col Steve Wilson, the first successful U.S. antigravity flight took place on
July 18, 1971 at S-4 dreamland [Area 51] wherein light bending capabilities were also
demonstrated to obtain total invisibilities.” [62] A number of military whistleblowers
suggest that the US currently has a fleet of ET reverse engineered ships with antigravity
propulsion systems and that manned flights to the Moon and even Mars are regular
occurrences by the clandestine organizations developing and using such technology. [63]
If Wilson’s date and description is accurate, it suggests that the US reached a similar
technological stage to the Nazis who presumably achieved this technological feat sometime
towards the end of the Second World War as evidenced by the appearance of the legendary
Foo fighters which bewildered Allied airmen on bombing missions over Germany. [64]
After an exhaustive study of this phenomenon, British researcher Mark Birdsall concluded:
“Without question, nearly all Foo-Fighter and Ghost Rocket reports can be categorized as
advanced technology channeled from ...various secret German WWII scientific facilities.”
[65] This suggests that a significant technological gap divided the US/USSR from the Nazi
elite who escaped to Antarctica with their prized technological assets and information
derived from their occult communications with ET races.
The presence of a significantly well-armed and undefeated Nazi presence in Antarctica and
South America would be kept from the general public and most elected officials. The
evidence for such a non-disclosure policy is evidenced by the secrecy surrounding the true
goals of Admiral Byrd’s Antarctic mission in 1946/47; and subsequent conflicts in the
Antarctic and South America. The level of secrecy even for senior political officials can be
gauged by comments by former Congressmen such as Senator Barry Goldwater who
served as Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. In response to a question by a
UFO researcher he stated: “This thing [ET affairs] has gotten so highly classified ... it is
just impossible to get anything on it.” [66]
The superior ET inspired technology achieved by Nazi remnants that allowed them to
continue to maintain remote bases would surely have disturbed the US and USSR. This
helps understand the basis of the cooperation between the major Western powers and the
Soviet Union and its satellite states, to globally manage the existence of ET races and
technology throughout the Cold War era, and to hide the truth about the threat posed by
remnants of Nazi Germany.
Conclusion: Global Management System for ET Affairs and the Legacy of the
Nazi-ET Connection
The management system designed by the Allied powers to deal with ET affairs, including
the legacy of the Nazi Germany-ET connection, are based circumstances that stem directly
from the Second World War. The desire not to disclose the existence of significant Nazi
bases in Antarctica and elsewhere was understandably based on perceptions by theleaderships of Allied states that this would lead to disclosure of the ET assistance received
by Nazi Germany. Due to the potential of this for disclosure of the ET presence more
generally, a policy that became a foundation for the global management of ET affairs after
the War, the truth about the Nazi bases would not be disclosed. Furthermore, the fact that
Nazi bases in Antarctica could not be militarily defeated suggested both the technological
superiority of Nazi weapons, and the likelihood that they continued to receive assistance
from one or more ET races preventing the eradication of Nazi bases. Given global public
perceptions of ‘complete victory’ in the Second World War, the Allied governments did not
want their respective national publics to learn of the major strategic defeat suffered by the
Allies with the successful establishment of a Nazi presence in Antarctica and South
America, and the Nazi-ET connection. This would mean that these technologically
advanced Nazi enclaves would pose a direct threat to the militaries of major world
governments. Perhaps more importantly, core Nazi principles such as elitist decision
making, eugenics, and militarism, would be a threat to ‘democratic’ values around the
globe, and how ET affairs were to be globally managed.
The chief legacy of the Nazi German-ET connection is that Nazi enclaves continue to
influence a key region of the planet, South America, leading to numerous political and
economic crises in that continent which continues to seriously impact on the lives of South
American citizens. Furthermore, there are claims by a number of researchers that Nazism
continues to covertly influence government policy at the highest level in countries such as
the US, Russia; and, to a lesser extent, Britain and France, through the Nazi scientists
expatriated into those countries after the Second World War. These former Nazi scientists
assumed prominent leadership positions in the clandestine projects to develop ET inspired
technologies, and thus became Trojan horses for Nazi principles and beliefs both in
government and corporations that fulfill numerous contracts that service the military and
intelligence communities in the US. This is especially the case in projects that involve ‘mind
control’ and ‘genetic’ experiments that utilize ET inspired technologies for a variety of
purposes that are not transparent and abusive of the rights of human subjects. There is
evidence that Nazi infiltration through the ‘Trojan horse’ of former Nazi Scientists into the
military-industrial complexes that oversee ET affairs is so significant as to constitute a
direct threat to democracy and liberty in the US and other major powers.
There is a need for full disclosure of ET affairs in general in order to make it possible for
humanity to make the transition to the reality of extraterrestrial life, and the political issues
that arise with dealing with ET affairs. There are not only ethical and political principles that
motivate full disclosure, but there are also significant national security principles at stake.
The very survival of the US as a bastion of liberty and democracy - key principles
established by the Founding fathers of the US – are at stake if clandestine projects dealing
with ET affairs and the continued Nazi influence, are not placed under the oversight of the
appropriate congressional and executive committees that are transparent in their operations
and reports. [67] A full Congressional inquiry into the true circumstances surrounding the
escape of Nazi elites and establishment of bases in Antarctica and elsewhere, by the USCongress and similar parliamentary bodies of other nations is immediately required. Such
official inquiries are needed to make the public more aware of how Nazi principles have
infiltrated into the key national institutions responsible for managing ET affairs, and the
threat this poses to democratic values and institutions. Evidence for infiltration of Nazi
principles into the key decision making bodies on ET affairs is given by whistleblowers
such as Dr Michael Wolf who claims that “within the UFO Cover-Up there is a dark,
covert renegade organization known as the ‘Cabal’. He describes it as a 'well-orchestrated
conspiratorial bevy of plotters ... top-heavy with the military, and headed by (a Navy
Under- Secretary).' He claims that the “paranoiac Cabal works against, and deliberately
undermines, the goals of peaceful negotiations with the extraterrestrial visitors.” [68]
At a global level, there is a similar threat that key institutions that manage ET affairs have
become infiltrated by Nazi elites and/or Nazi principles. It is imperative that the public
becomes fully informed of the variety of ET races in existence, their activities and agendas,
and to identify those races that have been most active in supporting the Nazi elite and their
activities since the end of the Second World War. While achieving transparency in the full
range of activities, agendas and motivations of ET races is extraordinarily complex, it is
certainly worth investigating why one or more ET races assisted in the development in the
Nazi’s advanced technology, and may be playing a role in the expansion of Nazi principles
in the national and global management of ET affairs. There remains the danger of an
unnecessary military confrontation with ET races who, it is claimed in the majority of
whistleblower testimonies, demonstrate little hostile intent to global humanity, and indeed
have thus far demonstrated remarkable resilience in not retaliating against attacks from
clandestine government organizations. [69] Delay in addressing the influence of Nazi elites
and/or Nazi principles in the global management of ET affairs may result in a series of
events that have tragic consequences for the sovereignty and freedom of humanity for
generations to come.
