1. The difference between Chris Ruddy and Mike Wallace is that Chris Ruddy is a hard-working reporter who wants to get at the facts, while Mike Wallace is a geriatric hatchet-man who apparently didn't recall that Ft. Marcy Park had been closed for weeks in an on-going investigation into the death of Vince Foster.
2. CBS implied the carpet fibers on Foster's clothes were the result of Foster's new carpet. Are we to also infer that the semen stains were the result of Foster's new girlfriend?
3. Meanwhile there is another conspiracy theory going around: Critics of the Clinton administration are inspired by Satan. Perhaps we'll have a national witch-hunt with Mike Wallace playing the role of Grand Inquisitor.
4. One of the functions served by the largely irrelevant debates regarding the evidential discrepancies at Ft. Marcy Park is to prevent the asking of questions with respect to the larger picture; namely, What was Vince Foster involved in that led to his death? Who killed him? and Why? No, it is much, much safer that we spend countless days focused on the burning issue of whether Vince Foster was left- or right-handed.
5. One of these omitted larger questions concerns the relationship of Vince Foster to Clinton's financial backer Jackson Stephens, and to the latter's role in money-laundering and drugs-for-arms deals. Jackson Stephens is the Little Rock billionaire who has held substantial interest in Worthen National Bank as well as in Stephens Inc., one of the largest privately owned investment banks outside Wall Street. Worthen gave the Clinton campaign a $3.5 million dollar line of credit.
6. Crucial parts of the Arkansas laundry were created when Stephens married his political connections in Panama and Washington to his Little Rock financial institutions and his Little Rock software firm Systematics.
7. It began when Stephens helped bring BCCI (the Bank of Credit and Commerce International) to America. The details of this story are important, because it represents the beginnings of a cozy relationship between Jackson Stephens, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Webster Hubbell, Bert Lance, Systematics, Vince Foster, and BCCI.
Stephens, a 1946 Naval Academy graduate, had joined with William Middendorf II (Secretary of the Navy under Nixon and Ford) in April 1977 to acquire Financial General, a Washington D.C.-based bank with headquarters a block from the White House.
'Some people might think it is important to know about the outstanding loans and balances of Government officials,' a Washington banking executive noted at the time.
Stephens then sent salesmen from Systematics to talk to Middendorf about providing banking software for Financial General. When these salesmen were firmly rejected, Stephens decided to wrest control of the bank from Middendorf. To do so he solicited the help of Bert Lance, Jimmy Carter's Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Lance knew the executives at Financial General, because they had sold him controlling interest in the National Bank of Georgia in 1975.
Stephens himself had met Lance through President Carter, his old roommate from Naval Academy days.
In November 1977, Stephens introduced Lance to BCCI founder Agha Hasan Abedi, and Abedi in turn introduced Lance to investor Gaith Pharaon. Pharaon, acting on behalf of Abedi, proceeded to acquire the stock of Bert Lance's National Bank of Georgia, a deal consummated on January 5, 1978, a day after Lance's $3.4 million loan from the First National Bank of Chicago was repaid by BCCI London.
Lance then joined with Jackson Stephens to help BCCI take over Financial General. A Financial General lawsuit filed on February 17 named 'Bert Lance, Bank of Credit & Commerce International, Agha Hasan Abedi, Eugene J. Metzger, Jackson Stephens, Stephens Inc., Systematics Inc. and John Does numbers 1 through 25.'
8. In that law-suit, Systematics was represented by C.J. Giroir, Webster Hubbell, and Hillary Rodham Clinton of the Rose Law Firm. Vince Foster would later tell the American Lawyer that Hillary Clinton did all the intellectual property work for Systematics.
Part of this 'intellectual property' would involve a banking- transaction software system based on the stolen PROMIS software. A telecommunications back-door to the PROMIS software was introduced by Michael Riconosciuto, now in prison, but then Director of Research for a Wackenhut Corp.-Cabazon Indian Reservation joint venture. In an affidavit, Riconosciuto says the copy of the PROMIS software he received was given to Wackenhut by Justice Dept. official Peter Videnieks. Earl Brian, acting through Wackenhut, then gave it to Riconosciuto.
Earl Brian, who later sold the same software to Iraq using the arms dealer Carlos Cardoen as an intermediary, will undoubtedly have some- thing to say about all this, as he has been indicted in California for fraudulent lease transactions undertaken while he was head of Financial News Network, United Press International, and Infotechnology.
9. In the same Financial General lawsuit, Bert Lance's attorney was Robert Altman, who later became President of the bank when it was finally taken over. Altman's mentor Clark Clifford (the former Defense Secretary under Lyndon Johnson) who also acted as BCCI's attorney became the bank's Chairman.
10. The Financial General takeover attempt did not succeed right away. In another lawsuit, one filed March 18, 1978, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Bert Lance with violations of federal security laws, and BCCI's application to purchase Financial General Bankshares was denied.
Abedi then formed a new takeover vehicle called Credit and Commerce American Holdings (CCAH), based in the Netherlands Antilles. The largest investor in CCAH was Kamal Adham (the former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence), who put up $13 million of his own money On October 19, 1978, CCAH filed for approval with the Federal Reserve to purchase Financial General. This application was dismissed on February 16, 1979, due to opposition from Financial General's Maryland subsidiary, but a new application was submitted later.
The Federal Reserve finally approved the purchase in on April 19, 1982, and BCCI renamed the bank 'First American' three months later. The head of Bank Supervision at the Federal Reserve when BCCI's purchase was approved was Jack Ryan, who later became head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, in which role he would deny Rep. Leach's requests for documents related to Madison Guaranty, the Whitewater thrift.
11. BCCI was the center of a global laundry and a conduit for transactions involving arms, drugs, and nuclear technology.
Firstly, BCCI had the motive. BCCI founder Abedi was committed to the development of an Islamic atomic bomb, even donating 500 million rupees for the creation of Pakistan's Gulam Ishaq Research Institute for nuclear development. (BCCI paid the lawyer for Dr. Abdul Qader Khan, head of Pakistan's nuclear program, who a Dutch court convicted in 1983 of stealing the blueprints for a uranium enrichment factory. Three Pakistanis indicted in Houston in 1984 had tried to buy nuclear triggers using BCCI gold. A Pakistani-born Canadian, indicted in Philadelphia in 1987 for conspiracy to export restricted specialty steel and metal to enhance nuclear explosions, paid for the materials through BCCI Toronto. Etc.)
Secondly, BCCI had the right political connections. BCCI-founder Abedi got Jimmy Carter to publicize BCCI to heads of state around the world. Abedi made his personal 727 jet available to Carter, and accompanied the former President to Thailand, Tibet, Hong Kong, and the Soviet Union, among other places. Carter introduced Abedi to many heads of state, from Deng Xiaoping in China to James Callahan in the U.K. Abedi donated a half million dollars to establish the Carter presidential library, and a public policy institute at Emory university.
Thirdly, BCCI had the right intelligence connections. Kamal Adham, who became the lead frontman in BCCI's takeover of First American, had also been the CIA's principal liaison for the entire Middle East from the mid- 1960's through 1979. The CIA utilized BCCI for its own payments. For example, Manuel Noriega, who was recruited by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in 1959, who went on the CIA payroll in 1967, and who became head of Panamanian military intelligence in 1968, was paid through the Panamanian branch of BCCI. The CIA also used BCCI branches in Pakistan to launder payments to the Afghan rebels, and Pakistani officials used the same bank to launder heroin profits.
Fourthly, BCCI had the right U.S. financial connections. Jackson Stephens would later capitalize on the $100,000 donation he made to the 1988 campaign of George Bush (thereby becoming a member of Bush's 'Team 100'), as well as his friendship with George Bush, Jr., to to get BCCI involved in funding a lucrative Harken Energy offshore project in Bahrain. The money apparently came through the Swiss BCCI subsidiary.
12. Stephens' principal motive in bringing BCCI to America was apparently to connect up his own financial institutions to the global laundry--not only First American, but those in Little Rock also. To avoid the type of SEC scrutiny involved in the Financial General takeover, Webster Hubbell, who had represented Stephens' software company Systematics, was employed to draw up the charter for the Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA). The structure for the laundry was then in place.
One form of Stephens' laundry worked through front companies set up by bond broker Don Lasater. These companies would deposit cash in banks such as Stephens' Worthen Bank, which would not fill out reporting forms. In return for this service, the companies would be obligated to buy bonds issued by the ADFA, and underwritten by Stephens' investment bank Stephens Inc. Stephens would thus be compensated for the laundering service in the form of an investment banking fee.
The money from the bond issue, meanwhile, would go back to the same front companies. That is, in effect the companies bought their own bonds and paid Stephens a fee for the service.
The participation of the ADFA, a state government institution, eliminated SEC scrutiny. ADFA formally issued and 'guaranteed' the bonds, and thus collected a fee in the process. Some of these fees were translated into 'loans' to the political friends of the Governor of Arkansas, William Jefferson Clinton, now President of the United States.
At other times ADFA was itself the core of the laundry. At the end of December 1988, for example, the ADFA deposited $50 million in Fuji Bank in the Cayman Islands. Fuji Bank subsequently purchased the industrial development loan of POM, Inc., a parking meter and arms production company owned by Seth Ward, Webster Hubbell's father-in-law. Hubbell was also POM's corporate attorney.
13. Jackson Stephens had political connections in Panama, which was then becoming the banking center for the Colombian cocaine business. One of these connections was Gabriel Lewis, the Panamanian Ambassador to Washington who had negotiated the Panama Canal Treaty. Another was Manuel Noriega, the head of G-2 (Panamanian military intelligence) who made a deal with the Medellin cocaine cartel.
Stephens was the banker for Gabriel Lewis, who had gotten very rich after he created corrugated banana boxes. Gabriel Lewis' seaside home on Contadora Island, which Lewis then owned, was the site where Canal negotiator Ellsworth Bunker was told in August 1974 that Panama would re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba. Later the exiled Shah of Iran stayed at Lewis' home from December 1979 to March 1980, while Manuel Noriega provided for the Shah's security. (In his book Crisis, Hamilton Jordan tells how he tried to use Gabriel Lewis to help establish contact with the Iranians in the Iran-hostage crisis.)
Contadora Island would later become a conduit for drug shipments. One of Noriega's pilots, Cesar Rodriquez, became manager of Contadora Island's airline, and would appear at his club atop the Bank of Boston building with suitcases full of $100 bills. Rodriquez told marijuana smuggler Steven Michael Kalish, who wanted to bring $100 million in cash to Panama (whose currency is the U.S. dollar), to use the services of the Panamanian branch of BCCI, which handled both Rodriquez's and Noriega's accounts.
In 1982 Noriega had helped negotiate a truce between the Castro- backed M-19 in Columbia and the beginnings of the Medellin cartel. In subsequent coke shipments through Panama, another Noriega pilot Floyd Carlton Caceres would receive $400 per kilo, while Noriega would receive $100,000 to $200,000 per flight. But Noriega kept raising the transshipment price charged to the cartel under Pablo Escobar.
The feud escalated until in May 1984, Noriega let Escobar's new cocaine processing plant at Darien be destroyed (which also won him points with the Americans). Noriega, hiding out in Paris, then sent his political strategist Jose Blandon to talk to Castro, who mediated a settlement between Medellin and Noriega.
Subsequently Noriega closed a Panamanian bank for money laundering, because it was owned by a member of the Cali cartel--a Medellin competitor. Noriega also helped out the Medellin cartel by arresting or informing on Cali drug dealers to the DEA (whom effectively served as Noriega's private enforcer). The DEA publicly praised Noriega for helping shut down the Roberto Suarez Bolivian operation--another Medellin competitor.
14. The drug-arms-money laundering connection between Panama and Arkansas was apparently first cemented in the 'Iran'-Contra dealings. Both Panama and Arkansas were used by Oliver North as transshipment points for money and arms to the Contras.
(The word 'Iran' is in quotes since it was Iraq, not Iran, that the U.S. was mostly dealing with. Even Ollie North said 'the coverup is itself a coverup', because the focus of the later Walsh investigation into the minor dealings with Iran obscured the major dealings with Iraq. The outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980 caused great intelligence concern after the Reagan administration took office, because Iraq appeared in danger of losing the war. It became U.S. policy to assist Iraq. Those who sold arms and also nuclear technology to Iraq found the business very lucrative, and would continue the process after U.S. official policy changed.)
By 1983, two years after the death of Omar Torrijos, Manuel Noriega had outmaneuvered three higher ranking Colonels to became head of the National Guard, which he renamed the Panamanian Defense Forces at the suggestion of Israeli Michael Harari. Hararai, formerly high in the Mossad, had been demoted for assassinating the wrong 'terrorist'. He showed up in Panama and grew close to Torrijos by mediating between him and his Jewish father-in-law. Harari assisted Noreiga's G-2 in developing sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques. After Noriega's older brother and closest advisor Luis Carlos died in early 1984, Noriega began to call Harari his 'mentor'.
Harari's participation ensured that Israel got a piece of Ollie North's action. By December 1983 the Israelis had begun using a Panamanian CIA front company, IFMA Management Company, to funnel support to the Contras. Harari would later boast of his friendship with Donald Gregg, George Bush's national security advisor.
In October 1984 the Boland amendment was extended to say no U.S. intelligence organization could spend money to support the Contras. Bill Casey and Oliver North decided the White House was exempt, and North through Richard Secord set up a secret Contra account in Credit Suisse, Geneva, called Lake Resources. Similarly, Noriega's Geneva lawyer and business associate, Juan Bautista Castillero, set up a Contra aid front company called Udall Research Company. (Noriega and his political advisor Jose Blandon advised North that the Nicaraguan 'Southern Front' are really 'cafe guerillas', more interested in doing business and sleeping with prostitutes than in fighting, but North ignored their advice.)
15. According to what Money Laundering Bulletin calls 'The Greatest Story Never Told', an 'archive of more than 2000 documents. . . allege that western Arkansas was a centre of international drug smuggling in the early 1980s--perhaps even the headquarters of the biggest drug trafficking operation of all time' (March 1995).
The degree of Bill Clinton's knowledge of, and participation in, this operation is not always clear. Certainly CIA secrecy is not in itself sufficient to defend a supposed lack of knowledge on Clinton's part. Clinton was recruited into the CIA by Cord Meyer while Clinton was a student in London. This itself gave him a somewhat symbiotic relationship with George Bush, both while Bush was CIA director and later while Bush was Vice President.
According to R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., (in the October 1995 American Spectator), Arkansas state trooper L.D. Brown, after taking a return flight with Barry Seal carrying cocaine and money from Central America to Mena, reported the details to Governor Clinton, who said, 'That's Lasater's deal, that's Lasater's deal, and your buddy [or 'hero'] Bush knows about it.'
One CIA source who was watching Clinton closely in the early 80's is ambiguous as to how much Bill Clinton knew about the details of the Mena operation, but is somewhat more certain as to Hillary's knowledge (although Hillary was not a CIA agent, she had reliable information through the Rose Law Firm, and her own informants among the State Police), and confirms that Vince Foster was helping launder money at the time. He denies, however, that Foster was then involved in espionage. 'That came later,' he says.
16. Another thing that came later was the BCCI-financed arming of Iraq. What began as a simple U.S. strategy to maintain a balance of power between Iran and Iraq, turned into a vast money-making enterprise involving the sale of U.S. nuclear technology and nuclear secrets to both Iraq and Israel. In particular, the participation of Jackson Stephens and Hillary Clinton in the Pittsburgh-based nuclear network, along with the entrepreneurial (and deadly) activities of the Wackenhut Corporation, would eventually result in the untimely death of Vince Foster.

                    <p>The Cercle remains a bit of a mystery. It has been acknowledged from all sides that the meetings of this group are completely "off the record" and that members are not supposed to speak about these meetings at all. The Independent found that out in 1997 when members just hung up the phone without saying anything, and even as late as 2008 it was repeated that Cercle meetings are "off the record" <span class="style33">[<a href="#1">1</a>]</span> with Freedom of Information requests seemingly not making any difference: </p>
                    <p><span class="style111">"I asked the Home Office to disclose Home Office staff attendance at 'Le Cercle' meetings ... In an email response the Home Office denied any knowledge of 'Le Cercle'..."</span> <span class="style33">[<a href="#2">2</a>] </span></p>
                    <p>Yet, without a military hierarchy, some people just can't resist opening their mouths: Brian Crozier mentioned details in his biography; so did Alan Clark and  David Rockefeller  (even though he  changed the name of the group). And with the internet these days, small bits and pieces continue to trickle out. Chas W. Freeman, Jr., a big anti-Zionist and pro-Saudi oil guy, put  a speech he gave to the Cercle in 2008 online. Dr. Hooshang Amirahmadi, founding president of the American-Iranian Council, while acknowledging that the meeting he was at was "off the record", did exactly the same. And former Georgian intelligence chief Tedo Japaridze appears to be  only one of two or three Cercle members who actually added this group to his (online) biography. When it would be me running the Cercle, trying to keep it as low profile as possible, I would have a problem with all these people. What part of "off the record" don't they understand? </p>
                    <p align="left"><href="../orifice/free_paris_hilton.html"><a href="../hillary-did-911-the-evidence/tesla-papers.html"><img src="morgellons-disease/Cercle_members_fltr_Chas_Freeman_Tedo_J_Amirahmadi_Ted_Shackley.jpg" border=0 alt="Cercle" width="546" height="140"></a><br>
                      <span class="style31">Recently identified Cercle visitors and members (f.l.t.r.): Saudi oil guy Chas W. Freeman, Jr., former Georgian national security chief Tedo Japaridze, American-Iranian Council founding president Dr. Hooshang Amirahmadi and - believe it or not - CIA officer Theodore Shackley. Shackley's associate Thomas Spencer, who was the attorney for General John Singlaub during the "Secret Team" trials in the late 1980s, was another  Cercle member. </span></p>
                    <p>People like Freeman, Amirahmadi, and earlier Prince Turki Al-Faisal, may be thinking that just putting a speech online, without mentioning any names, does not compromise the Cercle. If that's what they are thinking, they're wrong. Each time a visitor  mentions that he has been invited to Le Cercle, he gives away details  what this group is about. In our previous article we already suspected that the Cercle is not only continuing the Cold War by trying to undermine capitalist opposition in Russia and Eastern Europe, but also that it has always been severely biased in favor of the Arab countries, this to the detriment of Israel. These newly identified members pretty much confirm this theory. Their biographies also made it possible to identify the apparent long term strategy of the Cercle. Following are some details on the new members:</p>
                    <p><u>Chas W. Freeman, Jr.</u>: Freeman was the principal American interpreter during Nixon's ground-breaking trip to China in 1972. Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller, like Nixon both involved with the Cercle, went to China in the same time-period and were equally important in  opening up that country to the West. Since going to China in 1972 Freeman has continued to be a key figure in U.S.-China relations. He was director for Chinese Affairs at the State Department from 1979 to 1981, deputy chief of mission and chargÃÂÃÂ© d'affaires in the American embassy in Beijing from 1981 to 1984, and later became co-chairman of the U.S. China Policy Foundation. He also received some flak in recent years for being on the advisory board of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, which has projects in Sudan and Iran.</p>
                    <p>Freeman also has close relations to Saudi Arabia and Iran, countries both represented in the Cercle. He was the U S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia  from 1989 to 1992, and received the CIA  Medallion in relation to the Gulf War in 1991. He became the long time president of the Middle East Policy Council (MEPC) in 1997. Directors of the MEPC have retired from functions at Exxon Mobil, the Saudi Binladin Group, Apollo Security, Central Command, the CIA, DIA and various ambassador posts in the Middle East. The Council is very pro Saudi, pro Iran, and very much against Zionism and neoconservatism. In addition, Freeman is a director of the American-Iranian Council (AIC), which also seems to count severe Cercle influence.</p>
                    <p>All in all, as might be expected from a Cercle member, Freeman has considerable intelligence connections - more so than already listed. He has been Assistant Secretary    of Defense and sat on the board of trustees of the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), a national security think tank from which the JASON Group once sprang. Ow, and he is no stranger to Bilderberg also. </p>

                    <p><u>Tedo Japaridze</u>: Formerly an important Georgian diplomat with close ties to the United States. In 2002 President Eduard Shevardnadze  appointed him chairman of the Georgian National Security Council. His predecessor  had apparently committed suicide and was accused of both homosexuality and involvement in the assassination of a journalist who tried to expose government involvement in a drug trafficking network linked to the Pankisi Gorge. This gorge is a center for international terrorism and Chechnyan resistance against Russia. </p>
                    <p>Japaridze survived the 2003 bloodless Rose Revolution, which brought Shevardnadze's presidency to an end. As happened with more than one revolution in this neighborhood, it was covertly supported by Madelaine Albright's National Democratic Institute (another supporter of the American-Iranian Council) and George Soros' Open Society Institute. The  Washington Post of November 15, 2003 summarized: <em>"Successive U.S. administrations have funneled more than $1 billion to Georgia, one of the highest per capita rates in the world. The CIA trained Shevardnadze's personal guards. President Bush dispatched Green Berets to train Georgians to deal with terrorists camped out in the lush but lawless Pankisi Gorge. "We used to be the darlings of Washington," recalled Tedo Japaridze, the Georgian national security adviser, who has six aides whose salaries are paid by the U.S. State Department. But now there are increasing signs that the long-indulgent United States has decided to stop cutting Shevardnadze so much slack."</em></p>
                    <p>Even now Japaridze has retired from public office, he remains a very influential figure in this part of the world. He has been or is president of the U.S.-Caucasus Institute in Tbilisi,  secretary general of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC), and alternate director general of the International Centre for Black Sea Studies (ICBSS) in Athens. He is furthermore "associated with" the Oxford-based Trilateral Group Ltd. (a group of international consulting firms) and the "Le Cercle Group/London". In 2009 he joined the Virginia Tech Center for Technology, Security, and Policy <em>"as an affiliate to support the center's ongoing counter smuggling projects in the Black Sea region"</em>.</p>
                    <p><strong><a name="amery"></a>Amery and Shackley: The  Atlantic Cercle, Inc. </strong><br>
                    In  <em><a href="../organisations/Le_Cercle.html"><span class="style104">Le Cercle and the Struggle for the European</span> <span class="style104">Continent</span></a></em> ISGP identified Conrad Gerber as a Cercle member.</p>
                    <p>Gerber has been a close friend to CIA spook Theodore Shackley. Shackley, whose had the nickname "blond ghost", retired from the agency in 1979 and (briefly) went into some oil business. But instead of joining the board of some regular, legal oil company, Shackley teamed up with oil smuggler John Deuss and Conrad Gerber, an economist in Ian Smith's racist white minority government of Rhodesia. Deuss, Gerber, Shackley and associates tried to keep Smith's government in power by evading the oil embargos, an effort that eventually failed. </p>
                    <p> Gerber moved on. He founded Petro-Logistics in 1980 and has been heading it ever since. Petro-Logistics basically is an intelligence firm focused on the international oil markets and has many connections in the Persian Gulf and  Black Sea regions. The firm's reports are an important source on OPEC for the International Energy Agency (IEA) and have a significant impact on the oil market. Throughout his life Gerber maintained a close friend of Ted Shackley. </p>
                    <p>Because of this information, and the fact that CIA men as William Colby and William Casey have been members of the Cercle, ISGP had already compiled a biography of Ted Shackley, assuming this person would sooner or later be identified as a Cercle member. We were right, because it now turns out that from 1994 to 2002 Shackley was the official owner of the Cercle. </p>
                    <p>ISGP actually found this out in a very simple way. Back in 2003 The Observer wrote:</p>
                    <p class="style111">"Founded in the 1950s by France's Antoine Pinay and German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer Le Cercle - also known as The Atlantic Circle..."</p>
                    <p>It has been the only source - anywhere - that referred to Le Cercle as "The Atlantic Circle". Nothing could be found under this name several years back. But a recent, more creative search on "Atlantic Cercle" turned up the following information on  Corporationwiki:</p>
                    <p><span class="style111">"The Atlantic Cercle - Incorporated by Julian Amery, Richard McCormack, Robert Zoelly, Theodore G Shackley, Thomas R Spencer, The Atlantic Cercle, Inc. is located at 801 Brickell Ave Ste 1901 Miami, FL 33131. The Atlantic Cercle, Inc. was incorporated on Wednesday, August 17, 1994 in the State of FL and is currently not active. Thomas R Spencer represents The Atlantic Cercle, Inc. as their registered agent." </span><span class="style33"><a href="#3">[3</a>]</span></p>
                    <p>The presence of Julian Amery immediately gives away that this group is Le Cercle. Amery was Cercle president from 1985 until the early 1990s, after which  his protege Jonathan Aitken took over the  presidency. </p>
                    <p>Julian Amery, who has held a variety of public offices, has been one of Great Britain's multi-faceted superspooks. As a strategist, he shared some ideas with Zbigniew Brzezinski. As already discussed in the 1001 Club article, it was Amery who once stated:</p>
                    <p><span class="style111">"The prosperity of our people rests really on the oil in the Persian Gulf, the rubber and tin of Malaya, and the gold, copper and precious metals of South- and Central Africa. As long as we have access to these; as long as we can realize the investments we have there; as long as we trade with this part of the world, we shall be prosperous. If the communists [or anyone else] were to take them over, we would lose the lot. Governments like Colonel Nasser's in Egypt are just as dangerous."</span></p>

______________________________________________________________________________

Plaintiff Jane Doe, proceeding under a pseudonym, brings this action against Donald J.
Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein, and alleges that:

PARTIES
1.

Plaintiff is an individual residing in and a citizen of the State of California.

2.

Upon information and belief, Defendants Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein

each reside in this District and are citizens of the State of New York.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
3.

Plaintiff is a citizen of the State of California for purposes of diversity jurisdiction

under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1332.
4.

Defendants are citizens of the State of New York for purposes of diversity

jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1332.

Case 1:16-cv-07673-RA Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 2 of 10

5.

This Court has original subject matter jurisdiction with respect to this action

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1332 as there exists complete diversity of citizenship between Plaintiff
and Defendants and the amount in controversy exceeds Seventy Five Thousand Dollars
($75,000.00), exclusive of interest and costs.
6.

Defendants are each subject to the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

Â§ 1332 with proper venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391 as both defendants are residents of
and/or are domiciled in this district and the events giving rise to the claims occurred in this
district.

RAPE, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, CRIMINAL SEXUAL ACTS, SEXUAL ABUSE,
FORCIBLE TOUCHING, ASSAULT, BATTERY, INTENTIONAL AND RECKLESS
INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, DURESS, AND FALSE
IMPRISONMENT
7.

Plaintiff was subject to acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts,

sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless infliction of emotional
distress, duress, false imprisonment, and threats of death and/or serious bodily injury by the
Defendants that took place at several parties during the summer months of 1994. The parties
were held by Defendant Epstein at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant
Epstein at 9 E. 71st St. in Manhattan. During this period, Plaintiff was a minor of age 13 and
was legally incapable under New York law of consenting to sexual intercourse and the other
sexual contacts detailed herein. NY Penal L Â§ 130.05(3)(a). The rapes in the first, second, and
third degrees; sexual misconduct; criminal sexual acts in the first, second, and third degrees;
sexual abuse in the first, second, and third degrees; and forcible touching (and, on information

2

Case 1:16-cv-07673-RA Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 3 of 10

and belief, predatory sexual assault) detailed herein are unlawful under New York law, e.g., NY
Penal L Â§ 130.20-130.52, and 130.55-130.65 (and, on information and belief, 130.95) and
constitute the torts of, inter alia, assault, battery, false imprisonment, and intentional or reckless
infliction of emotional distress, including threats of force and serious bodily harm, under New
York law. In addition, 18 U.S. Code Â§ 2255 provides Plaintiff with a civil remedy for personal
injuries because Plaintiff, while a minor, was a victim of violations of 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1591, 2421,
2422(b), and 2423(a) and she suffered personal injury as a result of such violations. Declaration
of Plaintiff Jane Doe, Exhibit A hereto; Declaration of Tiffany Doe, Exhibit B hereto;
Declaration of Joan Doe, Exhibit C hereto; Jane Doe, Tiffany Doe, and Joan Doe are each
pseudonyms as each woman wishes anonymity. Tiffany Doe, a witness, was an employee of
Defendant Epstein. Exh. B. Joan Doe, a witness, was a childhood classmate of Plaintiff who, in
the 1994-95 school year, was told by Plaintiff that Plaintiff was subject to sexual contact by the
Defendants at parties in New York City during the summer of 1994. Exh. C.
8.

Courts have discretion to allow proceeding anonymously where the need for

privacy outweighs the public's interest in knowing their identity and any prejudice to the
defendants. Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 189 (2d Cir. 2008). This
litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and identification of
Plaintiff would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to her and to others. Exh. A. All of the
ten factors that the Second Circuit articulated as relevant to this analysis favor anonymity,
especially factors 1-4, 7, and 10 (e.g., factors one and two: 'whether the litigation involves
matters that are 'highly sensitive and [of a] personal nature,'' and ''whether identification poses
a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the ... party [seeking to proceed anonymously] or

3

Case 1:16-cv-07673-RA Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 4 of 10

even more critically, to innocent non-parties''.), or are neutral with respect to anonymity.
Protecting Plaintiff's anonymity is also appropriate as she is a rape victim.
9.

Plaintiff was enticed by promises of money and a modeling career to attend a

series of parties, with other similarly situated minor females, held at a New York City residence
that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. At least four of the parties were attended by
Defendant Trump. Exhs. A and B. On information and belief, by this time in 1994, Defendant
Trump had known Defendant Epstein for seven years (New York, 10/28/02, ''I've known Jeff for
fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. 'He's a lot of fun to be with. It
is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger
side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.''), and knew that Plaintiff was then just
13 years old. Exhs. A and B.
10.

Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties.

On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff
to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the
course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but
with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff's pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in
the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Exhs. A and
B.
11.

Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened Plaintiff that, were

she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse of her by Defendant Trump,
Plaintiff and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. Exhs. A and B.
12.

Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with Plaintiff at two of the parties. The

second sexual encounter with Defendant Epstein took place after Plaintiff had been raped by

4

Case 1:16-cv-07673-RA Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 5 of 10

Defendant Trump. Defendant Epstein forced himself upon Plaintiff and proceeded to rape her
anally and vaginally despite her loud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike
Plaintiff about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff that he,
Defendant Epstein, rather than Defendant Trump, should have been the one who took Plaintiff's
virginity, before Plaintiff finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein. Exhs. A and
B.
13.

The threats of violence against Plaintiff and her family continued, this time from

Defendant Epstein, who again reiterated that Plaintiff was not to reveal any of the details of his
sexual and physical abuse of her or else, specifically, Plaintiff and her family would be seriously
physically harmed, if not killed. Exhs. A and B.
14.

While still under threats of physical harm by coming forward and having no

reason to believe that the threats have ever been lifted or would ever be lifted, Plaintiff, who has
suffered from stress, emotional distress, mental pain and suffering, among other problems, ever
since the assaults, was subjected to daily painful reminders of the horrific acts of one of the
perpetrators, Defendant Trump, via mass media coverage of him starting on or about June 16,
2015 that, over a short period of time, became continuous and unavoidable. Exh. A.
15.

As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by

Defendants upon her, Plaintiff has suffered stress, emotional distress, and mental pain and
suffering, as well as adverse physical consequences.
16.

As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by

Defendants upon her, Plaintiff has suffered physical pain and suffering.

5

Case 1:16-cv-07673-RA Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 6 of 10

17.

As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by

Defendants upon her, Plaintiff has been subjected to public scorn, hatred, and ridicule and has
suffered threats against her life and physical safety.
18.

As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by

Defendants upon her, Plaintiff has incurred special damages, including medical and legal
expenses.
19.

The sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by Defendants upon Plaintiff were

intentional acts.
20.

The conduct of Defendants demonstrates willful, reckless and intentional conduct

that raises a conscious indifference to consequences.
21.

At the appropriate time in this litigation, Plaintiff shall amend her complaint to

assert a claim for punitive damages against Defendants in order to punish Defendants for their
actions and to deter Defendants from repeating their conduct.

TOLLING OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
22.

Any statute of limitations applicable to rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual

acts, sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless infliction of
emotional distress, false imprisonment of a minor, if any, is tolled owing to the continuous and
active duress imposed upon Plaintiff by Defendants that effectively robbed Plaintiff of her free
will to commence legal action until the present time. Cullen v. Margiotta, 811 F.2d 698, 722
(2nd Cir.1987); Ross v. United States, 574 F. Supp. 536, 542 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). More
particularly, Plaintiff was unrelentingly threatened by each Defendant that, were she ever to
reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to her by Defendants, Plaintiff

6

Case 1:16-cv-07673-RA Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 7 of 10

and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. The duress has not terminated and the
fear has not subsided. The duress is an element of or inherent in the underlying causes of action
complained of herein. The duress and coercion exerted by Defendants has been such as to have
actually deprived Plaintiff of her freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time, and it rose to
such a level that a person of reasonable firmness in Plaintiff's situation would have been unable
to resist. Exhs. A and B.
23.

Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man

and indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed,
Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn't ever say anything if she didn't want to disappear
like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with
Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was
capable of having her whole family killed. Exhs. A and B.
24.

The duress had prevented Plaintiff from starting litigation before this year.

However, as soon as she surfaced, she received threats. More specifically, shortly after her first
complaint was filed in California on April 26, 2016, she started receiving threatening phone calls
on her cell phone. Exh. A.
25.

Defendants are equitably estopped from arguing that any statute of limitations has

not been tolled as Defendants wrongfully forced Plaintiff to refrain from timely commencing this
action by threats, duress, and other misconduct. Exhs. A and B. Zimmerman v. Poly Prep
Country Day School, ___ F.Supp.2d ___ (2012), 2012 WL 3683393; General Stencils, Inc. v.
Chippa, 18 N.Y.2d 125, 127 (1966)('a wrongdoer should not be able to take refuge behind the
shield of his own wrongdoing.').

7

Case 1:16-cv-07673-RA Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 8 of 10

26.

Moreover, this action has been brought before the facts giving rise to the estoppel

have ceased to be operational (i.e., while still under threats of physical harm by coming forward
and having no reason to believe that the threats have ever been lifted or would ever be lifted) and
since Plaintiff has decided to seek redress at this time, Plaintiff seeks an order of protection in
favor of Plaintiff and all associated with her so as to protect them from harm and harassment
from Defendants and their agents and associates. Exh. A.

DEFAMATION
27.

On information and belief, on or about April 28, 2016, Defendant Trump

provided the following statement to American Media, Inc. and/or Radar Online LLC for
publication on at least their website RadarOnline.com regarding Plaintiff's complaint ED CV 16797-DMG (KSx) filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California:
'The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly
framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is
absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.' The statement provided for publication by
Defendant Trump was published by said website and has been republished elsewhere in whole or
in part numerous times (and similar statements of an attorney for Defendant Trump were also
published, including on September 22, 2016 by Courthouse News Service). The statements
provided for publication by Defendant Trump and his agent and that were published by said
websites are false as they pertain to Plaintiff.
28.

The published statements are libelous on their face, and clearly expose Plaintiff to

hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy.

8

Case 1:16-cv-07673-RA Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 9 of 10

29.

As a proximate result of the above-described publications, Plaintiff has suffered

loss of her reputation, shame, mortification, and injury to her feelings, all to her damage in an
amount to be established by proof at trial.
30.

The above-described publications were not privileged because they were

published by Defendant Trump and his agent with malice, hatred and ill will toward Plaintiff and
the desire to injure her.
31.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendant Trump's defamation of Plaintiff,

Plaintiff has been subjected to public scorn, hatred, and ridicule and has suffered other injury.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendants and for the
following relief:
A.

That judgment be entered against Defendants for special damages, compensatory

damages, and punitive damages in an amount which shall be shown to be reasonable and just by
the evidence and in excess of Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), exclusive of interests
and costs;
B.

That all costs of this action be assessed against Defendants, including all

reasonable attorney's fees, costs and expenses of this action;
C.

That an order of protection in favor of Plaintiff and all associated with her be

issued so as to protect them from harm and harassment from Defendants and their agents and
associates; and
D.

Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S REQUEST FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

I, Jane Doe, the Plaintiff in this matter proceeding under a pseudonym, state as follows:
~

1.
I am a competent adult over 18 years of age able to testify as to personal knowledge. The facts
in this declaration are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and I am
competent to testify to them if called upon to do so.
2.
I was subject to extreme sexual and physical abuse by the Defendants, including forcible rape,
that took place at several parties of Defendant Epstein during the summer of 1994 in New York City at a
residence used by Defendant Epstein. During this period, I was 13 years old.
3.
More particularly, I traveled by bus to New York City in June 1994 in the hope of starting a
modeling career. I went to several modeling agencies but was told that I needed to put together a
modeling portfolio before I would be considered. I then went to the Port Authority in New York City to
start to make my way back home. There I met a woman who introduced herself to me as Tiffany. She
told me about the parties and said that, if I would join her at the parties, I would be introduced to
people who could get me into the modeling profession. Tiffany also told me I would be paid for
attending.
4.
The parties were held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey
Epstein. Each of the parties had other minor females and a number of guests of Mr. Epstein, including
Defendant Donald Trump at four of the parties I attended. I understood that both Mr. Trump and Mr.
Epstein knew that I was 13 years old.
5.
Defendant Trump had sexual contact with me at four different parties in the summer of 1994.
On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied me to a bed,
exposed himself to me, and then proceeded to forcibly rape me. During the course of this savage sexual
attack, I loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but he did not. Defendant Trump responded to
my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do
whatever he wanted.
6.
Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal
any of the details of Defendant Trump's sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be
physically harmed if not killed.
7.
Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with me at two of the parties that summer. On the
second occasion involving Defendant Epstein, Defendant Epstein forced himself upon me and proceeded
to rape me anally and vaginally despite my loud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to
strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant
Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump, before I finally
managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.

-------

Case 1:16-cv-07673-UA Document 4-1 Filed 10/03/16 Page 2 of 2

8.
Immediately following this rape, just like Defendant Trump, Defendant Epstein threatened me
not to ever reveal any of the details of Defendant Epstein's sexual and physical abuse of me or else my
family and I would be physically harmed if not killed.
9.
Both Defendants had let me know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated
that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed, Defendant Trump stated
that I shouldn't ever say anything if I didn't want to disappeifr like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was
forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third
incident, and ~hat he was capable of having my whole family killed.
10.
The duress imposed on me by Defendants not to ever reveal any of the details of the sexual and
physical abuse caused to me by Defendants has not terminated and the fear it has instilled in me has not
subsided. Unfortunately, making matters worse for me, I was subjected to daily painful reminders of
the horrific acts of Defendant Trump via mass media coverage of him starting last summer that, over a
short period of time, became continuous and unavoidable.
11.
The duress had prevented me from starting litigation before this year. However, as soon as I
surfaced, I received threats. More specifically, shortly after my first complaint was filed in California on
April 26, 2016, I started receiving threatening phone calls on a cell phone I then owned. The calls were
never for more than 20 seconds or so before they hung up and they were always from a blocked or
unavailable phone number according to my caller ID feature. Since I changed phone numbers, the
threatening calls have completely stopped.
12.
This litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and I believe
that identification of me would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to me and to others.
13.
I have no reason to believe that the Defendants' threats have ever been lifted or will ever be
lifted and so I request that the Court issue an order protecting me and my family from harm and
harassment by the Defendants.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

DATED: June 18, 2016



Case 1:16-cv-07673-UA Document 4-2 Filed 10/03/16 Page 1 of 2

DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S REQUEST FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

I, Tiffany Doe, a pseudonym, state as follows:

1.

I am a competent adult over 18 years of age able to\testify as to personal knowledge. The facts

in this declaration are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and I am
competent to testify to them if called upon to do so.
2.

I originally met Jeffrey E. Epstein in New York City in 1990 when I was the age of 22. I attended a

series of parties in that same year of 1990 where I was paid to entertain various guests of Mr. Epstein.
3.

In the year 1991, I was promoted to the occupation of party planner in which my duties were to

get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties.
4.

I was hired by and paid directly by Mr. Epstein from the years of 1991-2000 to attract adolescent

women to attend these parties, most of which were held at what is known as the Wexner Mansion
located at 9 E. 71st St. in New York City.
5.

In June, 1994 while performing my duties as a recruiter of adolescent women to attend Mr.

Epstein's parties, I met a 13-year-old adolescent woman, the Plaintiff in this matter, at the Port
Authority in New York City who said that she had come to New York City in the hope of starting a
modeling career.
6.

I persuaded the Plaintiff to attend a series of parties of Mr. Epstein that took place during the

summer of 1994. I told her that, if she would join me at the parties, she would be introduced to people
who could get her into the modeling profession and she would be paid for attending.
7.

It was at these series of parties that I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform

various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were
advised that she was 13 years old.
8.

I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr.

Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her
despite her pleas to stop.

Case 1:16-cv-07673-UA Document 4-2 Filed 10/03/16 Page 2 of 2

9.

I personally witnessed the one occasion where Mr. Trump forced the Plaintiff and a 12-year-old

female named Maria perform oral sex on Mr. Trump and witnessed his physical abuse of both minors
when they finished the act.
10.

I personally witnessed or was made immediately aware of the two occasions where my boss Mr.

Epstein attempted to rape and sodomize the Plaintiff. I pers\,nally witnessed Mr. Epstein sexually and
physically abuse other minor females even younger than her.
11.

It was my job to personally witness and supervise encounters between the underage girls that

Mr. Epstein hired and his guests.
12.

I personally witnessed Mr. Trump physically threaten the life and well-being of the Plaintiff if she

ever revealed any details of the physical and sexual abuse suffered by her at the hands of Mr. Trump.
13.

I personally witnessed Mr. Epstein physically threaten the life and well-being of the Plaintiff if

she ever revealed the details of the physical and sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Mr. Epstein
or any of his guests.
14.

I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn't ever say anything

if she didn't want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her
whole family killed.
15.

After leaving the employment of Mr. Epstein in the year 2000, I was personally threatened by

Mr. Epstein that I would be killed and my family killed as well if I ever disclosed any of the physical and
sexual abuse of minor females that I had personally witnessed by Mr. Epstein or any of his guests.
16.

I am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that I

personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein, including the
Plaintiff, during the time of my employment from the years of 1990-2000 for Mr. Epstein. I swear to
these facts under penalty of perjury even though I fully understand that the life of myself and my family
is now in grave danger.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and

"></a>  <p>As an elitist, Amery was a member of the low profile Other Club since 1960, over the years together with the Duke of Devonshire (Cavendish), the 7th Marquess of Salisbury (Le Cercle), Lord Carrington (Pilgrims Society president), Lord Richardson of Duntisbourne (major Pilgrims Society member), Lord Rothschild, Lord Rees-Mogg, Prince Charles, Paul Channon (Le Cercle), Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Sir Edward Heath, Sir Denis Thatcher, and Winston S. Churchill. He also was a member of the Rhodesia and Nyasaland Club in the 1950s and 1960s and visited the White's Club. Amery and the Cecils largely ran the pro-apartheid Conservative Monday Club. This club was one of the staunchest supporters of the earlier-mentioned pro-colonialist, white minority government of Ian Smith in Rhodesia. It could well be that Amery was working together with Conrad Gerber and Ted Shackley during this time period. </p>
                    <p>Amery certainly wasn't a stranger to covert operations either. He was close to SAS founder David Stirling and Cercle member Col. Billy McLean. Together they tried to undermine Nasser in Egypt in the 1960s with help from the Mossad, arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, and the Cercle-affiliated royal houses of Jordan and Saudi Arabia. In the early 1990s, Stirling, and in all likelihood Amery, were also involved in  operations aimed at upholding the apartheid system in South Africa. Besides that, in the 1980s Amery was a consultant to the notorious BCCI. He also chaired the British branch of the Global Economic Action Institute,  financed by the Moonie cult. Around the same time he became president of Le Cercle.</p>

After Nugan Hand was exposed drug &amp; money laundering operations were moved to another bank, BBRDW, in which Casey, Armitage and George Bush were involved (Shackley had apparently retired by then). Shackley's co-founder of Atlantic Cercle, Inc., Julian Amery, later played a role in the BCCI, just as many other associates of Shackley. Shackley worked a lot with Miami mafia boss Santos Trafficante, who has been tied to the JFK assassination. Miami is also the state where Shackley ran the anti-Castro JM/Wave and is the state to which he retired and incorporated the Atlantic Cercle, Inc. in 1994.</span></td>

                      <span class="style31">The website address is spelled wrong. The 2001 forms showed the url with a double "c". It seems that even Cercle members themselves can't really decide on whether they are going to name their group Cercle or Circle. If the group indeed had a website in 2001 and 2002, it seems they are also confused about how low-profile they want to keep their meetings. </span></p>
                    <p>The tax filings show that Cercle meetings were organized once or twice a year, mainly at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, but also at the Conrad Hilton in London and the Lisbon Intercontinental in Portugal. The Sunday Telegraph of June 18, 2000, had already mentioned the meeting in Portugal, showing that Le Cercle meetings officially were arranged under Shackley's tax exempt organization. Below is a complete list of known Cercle meetings, which can be used by reporters to find out who has been at these meetings. The information in blue has been added with this article. </p>

                    <p>Besides Amery and Shackley, other founding officers of the Atlantic Cercle, Inc. were Richard T. McCormack, Thomas R.  Spencer, Jr., and Robert Zoelly.</p>
                    <p><a href="../libor-report/libor-threat.html"><img src="morgellons-disease/2000_Atlantic_Cercle_tax_form_last_year_Zoelly_appeared.gif" border=0 alt="n" width="546" height="185"></a><br>
                      <span class="style31">Officers of the Atlantic Cercle, Inc. in 2000. This is the last year that its Swiss director Robert Zoelly appeared. It seems people were getting old. Amery died in 1996. Shackley would pass away in December 2002. </span></p>
                    <p>McCormack has been a relatively high level politician in the offices of Nixon, Reagan and Bush. From 1992 until 2005 he was consultant to the U.S. Government on International Economic Affairs. From 2004 to 2006 he could be found at CSIS, just as many other Cercle members, and in 2006 he became vice chairman of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. He also sat on the board of Africa Petroleum, which has links to the National Intelligence Council, the CIA, another Cercle participant, and an association in London calling itself the International Oil Club. </p>
                    <p>Robert Zoelly appears to have been the Swiss director of the Atlantic Cercle. Virtually nothing is known about him, although he is probably the same Robert Zoelly who was  vice president of the U.S. department of the Schwarzenbach textile company in the 1950s. This Zoelly  returned to Switzerland in 1956 to become chief engineer of Linoleum A.G. Giubiasco. What this person did between 1956 and 1994 is not known at this point.</p>
                    <p> Atlantic Cercle, Inc.'s vice president and director Thomas R.  Spencer, Jr. is very interesting again, compared to what we know about Zoelly. Like Gerber, he has been a long time friend of Ted Shackley. Spencer    even was the lawyer for General John Singlaub <span class="style91">(OSS; founding member CIA; commander during the Vietnam war of the Military Assistance Group-Special Operations Group (MAG-SOG), a political murder unit; co-founder Western Goals Foundation in 1979 with the Englishman John Rees (board member of the notorious Cercle-linked Maldon Institute, from which some Illuminati disinformation has emanated) and Larry McDonald; founder U.S. chapter WACL in 1981; board member American Freedom Coalition, which was extremely close to the Moonie Cult; board member of the William J. Donovan Foundation, which in 2002 merged with the Pilgrims Foundation/Pilgrims of the United States. Other board members were the daughter of William Casey, Frank Wisner Jr., the 1001's Francis Kellogg, and William vanden Heuvel)</span> in 1988 when General Singlaub, General John Poindexter, General Richard Secord, Ted Shackley, Albert Hakim, and Lt.

                    <p>Back in 2006, ISGP came across this information after suspecting that Dr. Steven Greer of the Disclosure Project (who has been peddling ever increasing amounts of disinformation) had probably taken "inside" information from Jim Angleton, Jr. Apparently it was also Angleton, Jr. who provided researchers as Dr. Richard Boylan (pure disinformation), Dr. Harold Puthoff, author Robert M. Collins <span class="style91">(author of 'Exempt from Disclosure - The disturbing case about the UFO coverup', with contributions of Richard Doty and Timothy S. Cooper (Roswell and MJ-12 stuff))</span>, and others with bogus papers which he claimed were from Einstein and had been written in 1952. </p>
                    <p>This whole UFO and free energy involvement of Shackley, Spencer and Angleton, Jr. is something that warrants a very detailed investigation, especially since other researchers close to the Cercle have been responsible for spreading disinformation about the New World Order, the Illuminati, JFK, 9/11 (no plane theories, but this subject may have a different motive) and more and more it seems, about the UFO phenomenon.  Colonel Corso with all his intelligence and extreme right underground connections fits right in with this bunch. </p>
                    <p><strong><a name="chess"></a>The Cercle and Brzezinski's Eurasian chessboard </strong><br>
The combined biographies of  these newly-identified Cercle men - Freeman, Amirahmadi,  Japaridze, Shackley, and skipping Spencer - is quite reminiscent  of the contents of the 1997 book entitled <em>The Grand Chessboard:  American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives</em>, written by Zbigniew Brzezinski.</p>
                    <p><span class="style111"><a href="../mainway/keep-your-government-hands-off-my-medicare.html"><img src="morgellons-disease/Cercle_visitor_Zbigniew_and_grand_chessboard.gif" border=0 alt="Zbif" width="546" height="132"></a><br>
                        <span class="style31">Zbigniew  Brzezinski, who has visited the Cercle, seems to have put  the Cercle's long term strategy on paper. </span></span></p>
                    <p>Although it hasn't been established that Brzezinski is a full fledged Cercle member, it is known that he has given a speech to the Cercle. Furthermore, he has been named as a CIA operative and is  close to many past and present Cercle members, including David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, and former Cercle chairman Brian Crozier. Coincidentally, among his many, many functions, he has also been chairman and a director of the American Committee for Peace in the Caucasus, which is advocating against Russian intervention in Chechnya. See the  <a href="../organisations/Le_Cercle_membership_list.html"><span class="style104">Cercle membership</span> <span class="style104">list</span></a> for more information. </p>
                    <p>Brzezinski, his son Mark, together with the Eurasia Society, Albright's National Democratic Institute and  Soros' Open Society Institute, have  been accused of running the Ukrainian Orange Revolution  in late 2004 in an effort to push Russian influence farther back to the east. The year before, in November 2003,  the NDI and George Soros were accused of doing the exact same thing in Georgia; and in  2010 it was Kyrgyzstan. There have been other accusations which have never been investigated in much detail, but the picture that emerges here is that Brzezinski and his (Cercle) associates are following the "grand chessboard" strategy. Let's break this strategy down a bit. </p>
                    <p align="left"><a href="../libor-report/libor-threat.html"><img src="morgellons-disease/Likely_Cercle_affiliated_groups.gif" border=0 alt="a" width="546" height="120"></a><br>
                      <span class="style31">Several think tanks and foundations with likely close links to the Cercle. George Soros, whom ISGP suspects of being a Cercle member, runs the Open Society Institute and is a board member of the International Crisis Group. Cercle member Prince Turki Al Faisal is another board member of the ICG. Richard Armitage, who has been tied to  importing Golden Triangle opium with Cercle members as Casey, Shackley and Stilwell, can also be found here. Members of all these groups have similar political philosophies as the average Cercle participant. There are actually plenty of other foundations and think tanks that are probably close to the Cercle: Freedom House is one; the National Security Institute (Mark Brzezinski; Frank Wisner, Jr.) and Partnership for a Secure America are others. </span></p>
                    <p align="left">Following are some excerpts of Brzezinski's 1997 book: </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style111">"This huge, oddly shaped Eurasian chess board -- extending from Lisbon to Vladivostok -- provides the setting for "the game." ...</p>
                    <p align="left" class="style111"> America's global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderence on the Eurasian continent is sustained. ... <em>Eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the world's GNP and about three-fourths 
                      of the world's known energy resources. ...</em></p>
                    <p class="style111">"The geostrategic implications for America are clear: America is too distant to be dominant in this part of Eurasia but too powerful not to be engaged. </p>
                    <p><span class="style111">"It follows that America's primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it. Geopolitical pluralism will become an enduring reality only when a network of pipeline and transportation routes links the region directly to the major centers of global economic activity via the Mediterranean and Arabian Seas, as well as overland." </span><span class="style33">[<a href="#6">6</a>] </span></p>
                    <p>Brzezinski continues about Russia: </p>
                    <p class="style111">"Russian efforts to monopolize access need to be opposed as inimical to regional stability. However, the exclusion of Russia from the area is neither desirable nor feasible, nor is the fanning of hostility between the area's new states and Russia. In fact, Russia's active economic participation in the region's development is essential to the area's stability-and having Russia as a partner, but not as an exclusive dominator, can also reap significant economic benefits as a result. ... </p>
                    <p class="style111">"No other option can offer Russia the benefits that a modern, rich, and democratic Europe linked to America can. Europe and America are not a threat to a Russia that is a nonexpansive national and democratic state. They have no territorial designs on Russia, which China someday might have, nor do they share an insecure and potentially violent frontier, which is certainly the case with Russia's ethnically and territorially unclear border with the Muslim nations to the south. On the contrary, for Europe as well as for America, a national and democratic Russia is a geopolitically desirable entity, a source of stability in the volatile Eurasian complex."</p>
                    <p>In his book Brzezinski also talks extensively about his geopolitical views regarding  China and Iran. </p>
                    <p class="style111"> "A coalition allying Russia with both China and Iran can develop only if the United States is shortsighted enough to antagonize China and Iran simultaneously. ...</p>
                    <p class="style111">"In this region [Kazakhstan; Uzbekistan], America shares a common interest not only with a stable, pro-Western Turkey but also with Iran and China. A gradual improvement in American-Iranian relations would greatly increase global access to the region and, more specifically, reduce the more immediate threat to Azerbaijan's survival. China's growing economic presence in the region and its political stake in the area's independence are also congruent with America's interests. ... </p>
                    <p class="style111">"A close relationship with maritime Japan is essential for America's global policy, but a cooperative relationship with mainland China is imperative for America's Eurasian geostrategy."</p>
                    <p>Judging from Brzezinski's book, his main focus is on controlling the Southern (Near and Middle East) region of the chessboard while forming alliances with the Western, Middle, and Eastern spaces. Support from the West, in the form of the ever expanding European Union, is largely guaranteed. In the Eastern Space not a whole lot has changed either since 1997. Japan is still an important ally to the West and U.S.-China relations have not worsened since 1997. However, the situation in the Middle Space  dramatically changed in 2000 when Putin came to power. He expelled the pro-Western  oligarchs who under Yeltsin had taken over the Russian economy, including its oil and gas resources. The rise of Putin, who was succeeded in 2008 by his ally Medvedev, basically restarted the Cold War - a cold war that could slowly increase in temperature as it becomes increasingly obvious that the world's remaining oil and gas supplies are probably only sufficient for  short term economic growth. </p>
                    <p>Back in 1997, Brzezinski still assumed that the Caspian Sea Basin contained vast new oil reserves <span class="style33">[<a href="#7">7</a>]</span>. Today we know that this region is not a new  Saudi Arabia with its gigantic fields filled with the highest quality oil. The oil from the Caspian Sea Basin will delay the worldwide oil production peak, but not by much. That being said, it is one of the last places to go and Brzezinski's focus on this region remains actual. <span class="style33">[<a href="#8">8</a>]  </span></p>
                    <p>Azerbaijan is the most important Caspian Sea country  to the West. It has a considerable number of off-shore oil fields within its borders and is the closest country to the European Union. But for Azerbaijanian oil to flow to the West it has to pass through Georgian territory and from there through Turkey. An alternate route is over the Black Sea to Ukraine. Brzezinski wrote: </p>
                    <p class="style111">"Azerbaijan, with its vast energy resources, is also geopolitically critical. It is the cork in the bottle containing the riches of the Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia. The independence of the Central Asian states can be rendered nearly meaningless if Azerbaijan becomes fully subordinated to Moscow's control. ... An independent Azerbaijan, linked to Western markets by pipelines that do not pass through Russian-controlled territory, also becomes a major avenue of access from the advanced and energy-consuming economies [the West] to the energy rich Central Asian republics. ... </p>
                    <p class="style111">"Ukraine has supported Georgia's efforts to become the westward route for Azeri [Azerbaijan] oil exports. Ukraine has also collaborated with Turkey in order to weaken Russian influence in the Black Sea and has supported Turkish efforts to direct oil flows from Central Asia to Turkish terminals."</p>
                    <p><a href="../lhohq.html"><img src="morgellons-disease/Cental_Asia_map.gif" border=0 alt="centralasia" width="546" height="407"></a><br>
                      <span class="style31">Apparent Cercle aims: Form an oil land route from Azerbaijan to Georgia  to Turkey and to the E.U.  Maintain or improve relations with Saudi Arabia and Iran. Allow the Shiites to take over Iraq to bring it under Iranian influence. From here work to develop the various "stan" states while appeasing China and, if possible, Russia. </span></p>
                    <p>The map above should make it  easy to see  that friendly regimes in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey (and Ukraine on its own) are crucial in securing a stable supply of Caspian Sea oil. It also acts as a further corridor to the relatively vast oil reserves of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. </p>

And it is no secret that Bilderberg participants have been preparing Turkey for E.U. membership also. It actually appears that Bilderberg and the Cercle are working in synarchy, with Bilderberg focusing more on  economic and   overt political issues and Le Cercle focusing </td>

                    <p>Brzezinski  also wrote about the Balkans, although this region is not a prime issue. There are no vast oil reserves here and the new European Union states Bulgaria and Romania form a stable land route from and to Turkey. </p>

                    <p><strong><a name="zion"></a>The Cercle's  troubled relationship with  Zionism </strong><br>
                    Very interesting is the fact that  Brzezinski in his 1997 book completely skipped the Israel issue. It's likely he did this  to avoid the book being branded "anti-semitic" by the  Israel Lobby, resulting in all kinds of obvious problems. </p>
                    <p>As many other Cercle members, Brzezinski certainly isn't a fan of Israel. In more recent years it's slowly becoming possible to speak up against Israel's policies and its lobby in the United States.  Brzezinski has been among a small group of influential politicians who has taken the lead on this issue. In 2006, for example, he stated:</p>
                    <p><span class="style111"><em> "These neocon prescriptions, of which  Israel  has its equivalents, are fatal for America  and ultimately for  Israel. They will totally turn the overwhelming majority of the Middle East's population against the  United States. The lessons of Iraq speak for themselves. Eventually, if neo-con policies continue to be pursued, the United States will be expelled from the region and that will be the beginning of the end for Israel  as well." </em></span><span class="style33">[<a href="#9">9</a>]</span></p>
                    <p>Three years later Brzezinski made a statement that is virtually unheard of in terms of boldness:</p>
                    <p><span class="style111"><em>"Zbigniew Brzezinski, gave an interview to The Daily Beast in which he suggested President Obama should make it clear to Israel that if they attempt to attack Iran's nuclear weapons sites the U.S. Air Force will stop them. "We are not exactly impotent little babies," Brzezinski said. "They have to fly over our airspace in Iraq. Are we just going to sit there and watch? ... We have to be serious about denying them that right. That means a denial where you aren't just saying it. If they fly over, you go up and confront them. They have the choice of turning back or not. No one wishes for this but it could be a 'Liberty' in reverse.""</em> </span><span class="style33">[<a href="#10">10</a>]</span></p>
                    <p>Iran is a crucial state in both Brzezinski's and the Cercle's foreign policy agenda. And with oil becoming increasingly hard to pump out of the ground in sufficient quantities time is running out. For more than a decade now the Cercle crowd (and the Pilgrims and Bilderberg) have been trying to appease Iran, even contemplating the idea to allow it to gain control over Iraq and possibly  build nuclear power plants. These days the Cercle's American-Iranian Council is even apologizing to Iranian diplomats for the overthrow of Mossadeq and putting the Shah in power. They really want a closer, more stable relationship with Iran. And not only Iran, also with most other Middle-Eastern countries.</p>

                          In short, since World War II the Israelis have <em>tried</em> to ally themselves with the United States and Great Britain, covertly helping them in many of the dirtiest aspects of the worldwide war on communism. Helping to undermine a "communosocialist" country in South America, Africa, or even in the Middle-East? No problem. Ted Shackley and Julian Amery could  have told you all about it and in more than one instance neoconservatives share foundation/think tank boards with Cercle members. But appeasing (potential) enemies of Israel because of oil, or even allowing them to develop their own weapons of mass destruction, is out of the question for the Israelis.

                    <p>Virtually all of today's problems in the Middle East stem from the Jews having recolonized Palestine. But who can blame them after centuries of oppression? And after Western elites appeased both the Nazis and the pro-Nazi Arabs in the run up towards World War II, you can easily say the Jews earned their place in today's Israel. </p>
                    <p>But finding a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which the whole world is trying to do, is of secondary importance. The primary objective should be to break the power of the Israel lobby in the United States. This may not be an easy task, but it is an essential one. The fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians cannot solve their own religious and cultural problems should not keep the entire world hostage simply because the Palestinians are supported by the oil-rich Arab nations and the Israelis have hijacked the U.S. government. The world may extend a helping hand and the United Nations might step in when a genocide is about to take place, but that's it. The Jews and the Palestinians need to work it out themselves. It's their land - their responsibility. </p>
                    <p>So in that respect ISGP agrees with the views Brzezinski and several other Cercle members. </p>
                    <p><strong><a name="conclusion"></a>Closing thoughts </strong><br> 
                      Come to think of it,  in <em>theory</em> ISGP is actually a bit of a supporter of the writings of  Brzezinski and the apparent long term agendas of both Le Cercle and Bilderberg. Again in <em>theory</em>, ISGP can even go along to some extent with the idea to get involved in the drug trade to finance arms or black operations. There's no doubt in the author's mind that the Anglo-Saxon culture is the most evolved on this planet and the only one trying to take the lead in building a global civilization. Based on the fact that human history is nothing more than an endless  string of atrocities and the shifting borders due to war, maybe a more advanced and global civilization is exactly what we need. Now, Cercle members seem to focus primarily on power politics and natural resources, but their agenda coincides with the one of the "internationalist" bankers, i.e. the core of the Pilgrims Society and their associates in Europe. There's considerable overlap between the two: Brzezinski, Rockefeller, Kissinger, Volcker, probably Cyrus Vance, etc. </p>
                    <p>But although taking control of the world's resources can, according to this author, perfectly coincide with a long term humanitarian agenda, there's one thing that never changes. And that is the  idea  that the persons involved in all these groups in the end really do not seem to care about democracy or basic human rights. Over the years they supported too many wars for that, too many dictators, too many death squads, too many assassinations, they spread too much disinformation,  suppressed too many labor unions, and slowly are getting involved in too many child abuse scandals for their words about "democracy" and "free speech" to be credible.</p>
                    <p>In our previous Cercle article we already went into the rather racist and fascist tendencies of many of its members, including Cercle presidents Brian Crozier and Julian Amery. The close relationship of Cercle founders Jean Violet and Otto von Habsburg with the Cercle des Nations crowd in Brussels also does not spell much good (and you can bet more links will be found). In this article we discussed Chas Freeman's praising of Mao Zedong and his defending of  the Tiananmen Square massacre. And let's not forget Brzezinski here, who in his 1997 book also wrote:</p>
                    <p class="style111"><em>"It is also a fact that America is 
                      too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad. This limits the 
                      use of America's power, especially its capacity for military intimidationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ Democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization.</em></p>
                    <p> However, all this being said, how many people would want to get rid of these elites if the alternative is that we in the West would lose our access to much of the oil, gas and natural minerals we so desperately need for our economies to survive? Probably very few. Like has been said before, ISGP is not so much about exposing or finger pointing. It is all about understanding; trying to understand the way the world works. That's all. </p>
                    <p><strong><a name="last"></a>Last minute addition: six new names (including the 1001's founder) </strong><br>
                      One day after publishing this article, a reader pointed out that the old Cercle website, which existed from October 2000 to June 2002, could still be found at web.archive.org. <span class="style33">[<a href="#11">11</a>]</span> This was again an embarrassingly simple way (Google doesn't pick it up, by the way) to find  information on a group whose members not to long ago would just hang up the phone when questioned about the its activities. </p>
                    <p>Not counting the two speeches, it turns out that the Cercle's website, as listed in the tax forms, consisted of exactly one  ugly html page with only very basic information on it. It's not at all impossible that this website was put up just to take away the mounting interest in this group after several  newspaper exposÃÂÃÂ©s at the time. The website hardly added anything knew to the information that had already been reported in books or newspaper articles. Apparently it was taken down again six months before Shackley passed away. </p>
                    <p>Twenty-three names were mentioned on the website, six of which we didn't know about. These 6 members or visitors are described below, the most surprising probably being 1001 Club founder Anton Rupert. In some cases a lot of additional information, including sources, can be found in the <a href="../organisations/Le_Cercle_membership_list.html"><span class="style104">membership</span> <span class="style104">list</span></a>. </p>

Maybe it's not a surprise then that by the early 1990s, Schwarz-Schilling not only was chairman of Le Cercle, but also became a director of the International Crisis Group (mentioned earlier in this article). Zbigniew Brzezinski, George Soros, Morton Abramovich - all advocates of a NATO intervention - could be found here.

                          LE CERCLE A STATEMENT ON ORIGIN AND FUNCTION <br>
                          <br>
                          Le Cercle is an informal group of European and American professionals - politicians, retired Ambassadors, former Generals, lawyers and active participants in banking, oil, shipping, publishing and trading companies - who are interested in preserving a positive Atlantic dialogue. They meet semiannually in Washington, D.C. or at an overseas location to review topics of interest, mostly foreign policy. After each meeting, the participants return home and act on the issues that were discussed in whatever manner they choose. <br>
                          <br>
                          This group was founded in the 1950's by former french Prime Minister Antoine Pinay and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of Germany. In recent years, the Chairman of the group had been Britain's Lord Amery, a former Minister, QC, and member of Parliament. Lord Amery, because of declining health, yielded his stewardship of Le Cercle to Dr. Christian Schwartz-Schilling, a member of the Bundestag and former German Minister of Posts and telecommunications. The latter, in turn, passed the baton of leadership to Britain's Mr. Jonathan Aitken, member of Parliament and former Cabinet member. Mr. Aitken subsequently retired from political life. That resulted in Lord Lamont, former Chancellor of the Exchequer and a Member of Parliament, becoming the chairman of Le Cercle.<br>
                          <br> 
                          Le Cercle, in the past, has been honored to hear the views of such notables as Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller, William Casey, Franz Josef Strauss, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Zbigniew Brzezinski, General Norma Schwartzkopf, the Sultan of Oman, Otto von Hapsburg, Winston Churchill II, Charles Pasqua, Anton Rupert, King Hussein of Jordan and President Ion lliescu of Romania. <br>
                          <br>
                          The Cercle publishes papers and holds symposia for the public. <br>
                          <br>
                          The Washington, D.C. meetings are arranged in terms of administrative details by The Atlantic Cercle, Inc., an American 501(c)3 foundation. <br>
                          <br>
                          The Following are several papers prepared by Cercle members: <br>

Secret radar technology research that will allow the biggest-ever extension of 'Big Brother'-style surveillance in the UK is being funded by the Government.
The radical new system, which has outraged civil liberties groups, uses mobile phone masts to allow security authorities to watch vehicles and individuals 'in real time' almost anywhere in Britain.
The technology 'sees' the shapes made when radio waves emitted by mobile phone masts meet an obstruction. Signals bounced back by immobile objects, such as walls or trees, are filtered out by the receiver. This allows anything moving, such as cars or people, to be tracked. Previously, radar needed massive fixed equipment to work and transmissions from mobile phone masts were thought too weak to be useful.
The system works wherever a mobile phone can pick up a signal. By using receivers attached to mobile phone masts, users of the new technology could focus in on areas hundreds of miles away and bring up a display showing any moving vehicles and people.

<h1 style="font-size:72pt; font-weight:bold;">
An individual with one type of receiver, a portable unit little bigger than a laptop computer, could even use it as a 'personal radar' covering the area around the user. Researchers are working to give the new equipment 'X-ray vision' - the capability to 'see' through walls and look into people's homes.
Ministry of Defence officials are hoping to introduce the system as soon as resources allow. Police and security services are known to be interested in a variety of possible surveillance applications. The researchers themselves say the system, known as Celldar, is aimed at anti-terrorism defence, security and road traffic management.
However civil liberties groups have been swift to condemn the plan.
'It's an appalling idea,' said Simon Davies, director of Privacy International. 'The Government is just capitalising on current public fears over security to intoduce new systems that are neither desirable nor necessary.'

The system, used alongside technology which allows individuals to be identified by their mobile phone handsets, will mewan that individuals can be located and their movements watched on a screen from hundreds of miles away.
Prototypes have been effective over 50 to 100 metres but the developers are confident that range can be extended.
After a series of meetings with Roke Manor, a private research company in Romsey, Hants, MoD officials have started funding the multi-million pound project. Reports of the meetings are 'classified'.
Whitehall officials involved in radar confirmed that the MoD was 'very interested' last week. 'It's all about resources now,' said one.
Private security specialists have also welcomed the new technology.
'It will be enormously useful,' the director of one private security firm said. 'Instead of setting up expensive and cumbersome surveillance equipment, police or the security services could start work quickly and easily almost anywhere.
'For tracking a suspect, preventing a potential crime or a terrorist strike or simply locating people [the system] has enormous advantages.'
It is likely that the technology would be used at first to protect sensitive installations such as ports and airfields.
The perimeter of a nuclear power station or an RAF base could be watched without having a bank of CCTV screens and dozens of expensive cameras.
If the radar picked up movement then a single camera could be focused on a specific area.
Celldar could also monitor roads when poor visibility due to bad weather rendered cameras useless.
'The equipment could pick up traffic flows towards an accident site and the details of a crash; who is where and so on,' said Peter Lloyd of Roke Manor.
Lloyd also outlined a number of military applications for the technology. Individual armoured vehicles or even soldiers could carry the detectors which could tell them where enemy troops were.
Security specialists point out how useful personal radars would be in siege situations. However there are significant concerns that the technology might be abused by authorities or fall into the wrong hands.
'Like all instrusive surveillance, we need to be sure that it is properly regulated, preferably by the judiciary,' said Roger Bingham of Liberty.
Bingham expressed concerns that the new equipment, which would be virtually undetectable, could be used by private detectives or others for personal or commercial gain.
Modern technology has brought massive opportunities for wider surveillance. Since the 11 September terrorist attacks on Washington and New York, the government has been pushing through a package of anti-terrorism legislation which targets electronic communications.
Senior police officers are now allowed to access mobile telephone and email records without judicial or executive assent. Within two years, all mobile phones are expected to have satellite-locating devices built into them.
