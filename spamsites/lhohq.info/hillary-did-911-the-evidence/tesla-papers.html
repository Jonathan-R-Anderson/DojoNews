Random Physical Systems
Dean I. Radin 1 and Roger D. Nelson 2
Received May 6, 1988; revised June 12, ]989
Speculations about the role of consciousness in physical systems are frequently
observed in the literature concerned with the interpretation of quantum mechanics.
While only three experimental investigations can be found on this topic in physics
journals, more than 800 relevant experiments have been reported in the literature
of parapsychology. A well-defined body of empirical evidence from this domain
was reviewed using meta-analytic techniques to assess methodological quality and
overall effect size. Results showed effects conforming to chance expectation in
control conditions and unequivocal non-chance effects in experimental conditions.
This quantitative literature review agrees with the findings of two earlier reviews,
suggesting the existence of some form of consciousness-related anomaly in random
physical systems.

1. INTRODUCTION
The nature of the relationship between human consciousness and the
physical world has intrigued philosophers for millenia. In this century,
speculations about mind-body interactions persist, often contributed by
physicists in discussions of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.
Virtually all of the founders of quantum theory--Planck, de Broglie,
Heisenberg, Schr6dinger, Einstein--considered this subject in depth, (1) and
contemporary physicists continue this tradition. (2 7)

The following expression of the problem can be found in a recent
interpretation of quantum theory:
If consciouschoicecan decidewhat particular observation I measure, and therefore into what states my consciousness splits, might not conscious choice also
be able to influencethe outcome of the measurement?One possible place where
mind may influence matter is in quantum effects.Experiments on whether it is
possible to affect the decay rates of nuclei by thinking suitable thoughts would
presumably be easy to perform, and might be worth doing.Is~
Given the distinguished history of speculations about the role of
consciousness in quantum mechanics, one might expect that the physics
literature would contain a sizable body of empirical data on this topic. A
search, however, reveals only three studies.
The first is in an article by Hall, Kim, McElroy, and Shimony, who
reported an experiment 'based upon taking seriously the proposal that the
reduction of the wave packet is due to a mind-body interaction, in which
b o t h of the interacting systems are changed. ''~9) This experiment examined
whether one person could detect if another person had previously observed
a quantum mechanical event (gamma emission from sodium-22 atoms).
The idea was based on the supposition that if person A's observation
actually changes the physical state of a system, then when person B observes the same system later, B's experience may be different according to
whether A has or has not looked at the system. Hall et al.'s results, based
on a total of 554 trials, did not support the hypothesis; the observed
number of 'hits' obtained in their experiment was precisely the number
expected by chance (277), while the variance of their measurements was
significantly smaller than expected (p < 0.05).~9)
The second study is referred to by Hall et al., who end their article by
pointing out that a similar, unpublished experiment using cobalt-57 as the
source was successful (40 hits out of 67 trials). (1°)
The third study is a more systematic investigation reported by
Jahn and Dunne, (11) who summarize results of over 25 million binary
trials collected during seven years of experimentation with random-event
generators. These experiments, involving long-term data collection with
33 unselected individuals, provide persuasive, replicable evidence of an
anomalous correlation between conscious intention and the output of
random number generators.
Thus, of three pertinent experiments referenced in mainstream physics
journals, one describes results statistically too close to chance expectation
and two describe positive effects. (9-u) Given the theoretical implications of
such an effect, it is remarkable that no further experiments of this type can
be found in the physics literature; but this is not to say that no such
experiments have been performed. In fact, dozens of researchers have

reported conceptually identical experiments in the puzzling and uncertain
domain of parapsychology. Perhaps because of the insular nature of
scientific disciplines, the vast majority of these experiments are unknown
to most scientists. A few critics who have considered this literature have
dismissed the experiments as being flawed, nonreplicable, or open
to fraud, (12-16) but their assertions are countered by at least two
detailed reviews which provide strong statistical support for the existence
of anomalous consciousness-related effects with random number
generators. (17'18) In this paper, we describe the results of a comprehensive,
quantitative meta-analysis which focused on the questions of methodological quality and replicability in these experiments.

2. T H E E X P E R I M E N T S

The experiments involved some form of microelectronic random
number generator (RNG), a human observer, and a set of instructions for
the observer to attempt to 'influence' the RNG to generate particular
numbers, or changes in a distribution, solely by intention. RNGs are
usually based upon a source of truly random events such as electronic
noise, radioactive decay, or randomly seeded pseudorandom sequences/19)
Feedback about the distribution of random events is often provided in the
form of a digital display, but audio feedback, computer graphics, and a
variety of other mechanisms have also been used. Some of the RNGs
described in the literature are technically sophisticated, the best devices
employing electromagnetic shielding, environmental failsafe mechanisms
triggered by deviant voltages, currents, or temperature, automatic
computer-based data recording on magnetic media, redundant hard copy
output, periodic randomness calibrations, and so on. (18'2°)
RNGs are typically designed to produce a sequence of random bits at
the press of a button. After generating a sequence of say, 100 random bits
(0's or l's), the number of l's in the sequence may be provided as feedback.
In an experimental protocol using a binary RNG, a run might consist of
an observer being asked to cause the RNG to produce, in three successive
button presses, a high number (sum of l's greater than chance expectation
0f50), a low number (less than 50), and a control condition with no directional intention. An experiment might consist of a group of individuals
each contributing a hundred such runs, or one individual contributing
several thousand runs. Results are usually analyzed by comparing high
aim and low aim means against a control mean or theoretical chance
expectation.

3. META-ANALYTIC P R O C E D U R E S
The quantitative literature review, also called meta-analysis, has
become a valuable tool in the behavioral and social sciences. (21)
Meta-analysis is analogous to well-established procedures used in the
physical sciences to determine parameters and constants. The technique
assesses replication of an effect within a body of studies by examining the
distribution of effect sizes. (22 24) In the present context, the null hypothesis
(no mental influence on the R N G output) specifies an expected mean effect
size of zero. A homogeneous distribution of effect sizes with nonzero mean
indicates replication of an effect, and the size of the deviation of the mean
from its expected value estimates the magnitude of the effect.
Meta-analyses assume that effects being compared are similar across
different experiments, that is, that all studies seek to estimate the same population parameters. Thus the scope of a quantitative review must be strictly
delimited to ensure appropriate commonality across the different studies
that are combined. (2m5) This can present a nontrivial problem in metaanalytic reviews because replication studies typically investigate a number
of variables in addition to those studied in the original experiments. In the
present case, because different subjects, experimental protocols, and RNGs
were employed within the reviewed literature, some heterogeneity
attributable to these factors was expected in the obtained distribution of
effect sizes. However, the circumscription for the review required that every
study in the database have the same primary goal or hypothesis, and hence
estimate the same underlying effect.
Experiments selected for review examined the following hypothesis:
The statistical output of an electronic R N G is correlated with observer
intention in accordance with prespecified instructions, as indicated by
the directional shift of distribution parameters (usually the mean) from
expected values.
Because this 'directional shift' is most often reported as a standard
normal deviate (i.e., Z score) in the reviewed experiments, we determined
effect size as a Z score normalized by the square root of the sample size
(N), e = Z / x / N , where N was the total number of individual random events
(with probability of a hit at p = 0.5, p = 0.25, etc.). This effect size measure
is equivalent to a Pearson product moment correlation. (21)
3.1. Unit of Analysis

To avoid redundant inclusion of data in a meta-analysis, 'units of
analysis' are often specified We employed the following method: If
an author distinguished among several experiments reported in a single

article with titles such as 'pilot test' or 'confirmatory test,' or provided
independent statistical summaries, each of these studies was coded and
quality-assessed separately. If an experiment consisted of two or more
conditions comparing different intentions or types of RNG devices, the
data were split into separate units of analysis to allow the results to be
coded unambiguously. In general, within a given reviewed report, the
largest possible aggregation of nonoverlapping data collected under a
single intentional aim was defined as the unit of analysis (hereafter called
an experiment or study).
For each experiment, a Z score was assigned corresponding to
whether the observed result matched the direction of intention. Thus, a
negative Z obtained under intention to 'aimlow' was recorded as a
positive score. When sufficient data were provided in a report, Z was
calculated from those data and compared with the reported results; the
new calculation was used if there was a discrepancy. If only probability
levels were reported, these were transformed into the corresponding Z
score. For experiments reported only as 'nonsignificant,' a conservative
value of Z = 0 was assigned; if the outcome was reported only as 'statistically significant,' Z = 1.645 was assigned; and if sample size was not reported or could not be calculated from the information provided, a special
code of N : 1 was assigned.

3.2. Assessing Quality
Because the hypothesized anomalous effect is not easily accommodated within the prevailing scientific world-view, it is particularly
important to assess the trustworthiness of each reviewed experiment.
Unfortunately, estimating experimental quality tends to be a subjective
task confounded by prior expectations and beliefs. (26'27) Estimates of interjudge reliability in assessing the quality of research reports, for example,
rarely exceed correlations of 0.5. (28) We addressed this problem by
assigning to each experiment a single quality weight derived from a set of
sixteen binary (present/absent) criteria. The first author coded and
double-checked the coding for all studies; the second author independently
coded the first 100 studies. Inter-judge reliability for quality criteria was
r = 0°802 with 98 degrees of freedom.
These criteria were developed from published criticisms about
random-number generator experiments (14'15,29 33) and from expert opinion
on important methodological considerations when performing studies
involving human behavior. (2°'34,35) Collectively, these criteria form a
measure of credibility by which to judge the reported data. The criteria
assess the integrity of the experiment in four categories--procedures,

statistics, the data, and the RNG device--and they cover virtually all
methodological criticisms raised to date. They are (1)control tests noted,
(2)local controls conducted, (3)global controls conducted, (4)controls
established through the experimental protocol, (5) randomness calibrations
conducted, (6)'failsafe equipment employed, (7)data automatically recorded, (8)redundant data recording employed, (9)data double checked,
(10) data permanently archived, (11) targets alternated on successive trials,
(12)data selection prevented by protocol or equipment, (13)fixed run
lengths specified, (14) formal experiment declared, (15) tamper-resistant
RNG employed, and (16)use of unselected subjects.
Each criterion was coded as being present or absent in the report of
an experiment, specifically excluding consideration of previously published
descriptions of R N G devices or control tests. This strategy was employed
to reflect lower confidence in such experiments since, for example, randomness tests conducted once on an R N G do not guarantee acceptable performance in the same R N G in all future experiments. As a result, assessed
quality was conservative, that is, lower than the 'true' quality for some
experiments, especially those reported only as abstracts or conference
proceedings. Using unit weights (which have been shown to be robust in
such applications (36)) on each of the sixteen descriptors, the quality rating
for an individual experiment was simply the sum of the descriptors. Thus,
while a quality score near zero indicated a low quality or poorly reported
experiment, a score near sixteen reflected a highly credible experiment.
3.3. Assessing Effect Size

Assume that each of K experiments produces effect size estimates e of
a parameter E, based on N samples, and that each e has a known standard
error s. The weighted mean effect size is calculated as e. = ~ ~oiei/~ ~i,
where ~o~= 1/s~ = Ni, and i ranges from 1 to K. The standard error of e. is
Se = (Z CO;) 1/2. A test for homogeneity for the K estimates of e~ is given by
H K = ~ ~oi(e~--e.)2, where Hx has a chi-square distribution with K - 1
degrees of freedom. (37) The same procedure can be followed to test for
homogeneity of effect size across M independent investigators. In this ease,
e.j and Sej are calculated per investigator, and the test for homogeneity is
performed as HM=-Z ~oj(e.j--e.~) 2, where e. s and ~oi are mean weighted
effect size and 1/s~ per investigator, respectively, e . ~ = ~ w j e . j ~ o~s, and
j ranges from 1 to M. H ~ has M - 1 degrees of freedom.
For a quality-weighted analysis, we may determine e . o =
Z (Q~o~e~)/Z ( Q i ~ i ) , where Qi is the quality assessed for experiment i. The
standard error associated with eo is seQ = (Z (Q2imi)/(~ Q~eoi)2) 1/2; the
test for homogeneity is similar to that described above. Finally, following

the practice of reviewers in the physical sciences, (23'24) we deleted potential
'outlier' studies to obtain a homogeneous distribution of effect sizes and to
reduce the possibility that the calculated mean effect size may have been
spuriously enlarged by extreme values. The procedure used was as follows:
If the homogeneity statistic for all studies was significant (at the p < 0.05
level), the study that would produce the largest reduction in this statistic
was deleted; this was repeated until the homogeneity statistic had become
nonsignificant.
4. RESULTS
On-line bibliographic databases for psychology and physics journals
were searched, as was a specialized database covering parapsychological
articles, technical reports, conference proceedings and manuscripts.
Altogether 152 references were found from 1959 to 1987. These reports
described 832 studies conducted by 68 different investigators (597
experimental studies and 235 control studies). Fifty-four experimental and
33 control studies reported only as nonsignificant were assigned Z = 0. Six
experiments and two control studies coded as ( N = I , Z > 0 )
were
eliminated from further meta-analysis because effect size could not be
accurately estimated (this required the elimination of one investigator who
reported a single study). Figures 1 and 2 show the distributions of Z scores
reported for control and experimental studies, respectively.

These results, expressed as overall mean effect sizes, show that control
studies conform well to chance expectation (Fig. 3a), and that experimental
effects, whether calculated for studies or investigators, deviate significantly
from chance expectation (Fig. 3b, 3c). To obtain a homogeneous distribution of effect sizes, it was necessary to delete 17% of individual outlier
studies (Fig. 3d) and 13 % of mean effect sizes across investigators (Fig. 3e).
This may be compared with exemplary physical and social science reviews,
where it is sometimes necessary to discard as many as 45 % of the studies
to achieve a homogeneous effect size distribution. (~9) Of individual studies
deleted, 77 % deviated from the overall mean in the positive direction, and
of investigator means deleted, all were positive (i.e., supportive of the
experimental hypothesis).

4.1. Effect of Quality
Some critics have postulated that as experimental quality increases in
these studies, effect size would decrease, ultimately regressing to the 'true'
value of zero, i.e., chance results. (~2'13'~s'32'33'38) We tested this conjecture
with two linear regressions of mean effect size vs. mean quality assessed per
investigator, one weighted with coj as defined above and the other weighted
with the number of studies per investigator. The calculated slope for the
former is - 2 . 5 x 1 0 - 5 + 3 . 2 x 10 -5, and for the latter, - 7 . 6 x 1 0 - 4 ~
3.9 x 10 -4. These nonsignificant relationships between quality and effect
size is typical of recta-analytic findings in other fields, (39'4°) suggesting
that the present database is not compromised by poor experimental
methodology. Another assessment of the effect of quality was obtained by
comparing unweighted and quality-weighted effect sizes per experiment
(Fig. 3b vs. 3f). These are nearly identical, and the same is true after
deleting outliers to obtain a homogeneous quality-weighted distribution
(Fig. 3d vs. 3g), confirming that differences in methodological quality are
not significant predictors of effect size.
It might be argued that the quality assessment procedure employed
here was nonoptimal because some quality criteria are more important
than others, so that if appropriate weights were assigned, the
quality-weighted effect size might turn out to be quite different. This was
tested by Monte Carlo simulation, using sets of 16 weights, one per
criterion, randomly selected over the range 0 to 6. A quality-weighted effect
size was calculated for the 597 experiments as before, now using the
random weights instead of unit weights, and this process was repeated one
thousand times, yielding a distribution of possible quality ratings. The
average effect size from the simulation was 3 . 1 8 x 1 0 - 4 + 0 . 1 5 x 1 0 -4,
indicating that in this particular database coded by these sixteen criteria,

the probable range of the quality-weighted mean effect size clearly excludes
chance expectation of zero.
4.2. The 'Filedrawer' Problem

Although accounting for differences in assessed quality does not nullify
the effect, it is well known in the behavioral and social sciences that nonsignificant studies are published less often than significant studies (this is
called the 'filedrawer' problem(2~'41 43)). If the number of nonsignificant
studies in the filedrawer is large, this reporting bias may seriously inflate
the effect size estimated in a recta-analysis. We explored several procedures
for estimating the magnitude of this problem and to assess the possibility
that the filedrawer problem can sufficiently explain the observed results.
The filedrawer hypothesis implicitly maintains that all or nearly all
significant positive results are reported. If positive studies are not balanced
by reports of studies having chance and negative outcomes, the empirical
Z score distribution should show more than the expected proportion of
scores in the positive tail beyond Z = 1.645. While no argument can be
made that all negative effects are reported, it is interesting to note that the
database contains 37 Z scores in the negative tail, where only 30 would be
expected by chance. On the other hand, there are 152 scores in the positive
tail, about five times as many as expected. The question is whether this
excess represents a genuine deviation from the null hypothesis or a defect
in reporting or editorial practices.
This question may be addressed by modeling based on the assumption
that all significant positive results are reported. A four-parameter fit minimizing the chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic was applied to all observed
data with Z >~ 1.645, using the exponential
Y --

- ~1

e _ /~(ix_,t/~ )

(1)

to simulate the effect of skew or kurtosis in producing the disproportionately long positive tail. This exponential is a probability distribution
with the same mean and variance as the normal distribution, but with
kurtosis = 3.0.
To begin, the null hypothesis of a (0, 1) normal distribution with no
kurtosis was considered. To account for the excess in the positive tail,
N = 585,000 filedrawer studies were required, and the chi-squared statistic
remained far too large to indicate a reasonable fit (see Table I). This large
N, in comparison with the 597 studies actually reported together with the
poor goodness-of-fit statistic, suggests that the assumption of a (0, 1)
normal distribution is inappropriate.

a The null hypothesis is tested by clamping the mean at 0 and the standard deviation at l,
allowing N and E : N to vary. The empirical database is addressed by allowing all four
parameters to vary.

Adding simulated kurtosis to a (0, 1) normal distribution by mixing
exponential [Eq. (1)] and normal distributions in a 1:1 ratio reduced N by
two orders of magnitude, and ratios of 2: 1, 3: 1, and 10:1 exponential to
normal (E:N) yielded further small improvements. However, the chisquared statistic still indicated a poor fit to the empirical data. Applying
the same mixture of exponential and normal distributions, but starting
from the observed values of N = 597, mean Z score = 0.645, and standard
deviation = 1.60t, with the constraint that the mean could only decrease
from 0.645, resulted in much better fits to the data. Table I shows the
results.
This procedure shows that the null hypothesis is unviable, even after
allowing a huge filedrawer. The chi-square fit vastly improves with the
addition of kurtosis, but only becomes a reasonably good fit when mean
and standard deviation are allowed to approximate the empirical values.
The filedrawer estimate from this model depends on a number of assumptions (e.g., the true distribution is generally normal, but has a disproportionately large positive tail). It suggests a total number of experimental
studies on the order of 800, of which three-fourths have been formally
reported.
A somewhat simpler modeling procedure was applied to the data
assuming that all studies with significant Z scores in either the positive or
negative tail are reported. The model is based on the normal distribution
with a standard deviation = 1, and estimates the mean and N required to

account for the 152 Z scores in the positive tail and 37 Z scores in the
negative tail. This mean-shift model, which ignores the shape of the
observed distribution, results in an N = 1,580 and a mean Z score = 0.34.
These modeling efforts suggest that the number of unreported or
unretrieved RNG studies falls in the range of 200 to 1,000. A remaining
question is, how many filedrawer studies with an average null result would
be required to reduce the effect to nonsignificance (i.e., p <0.05)? This
'failsafe' quantity is 54,000--approximately 90 times the number of studies
actually reported. Rosenthal suggests that an effect can be considered
robust if the failsafe number is more than five times the observed number
of studies. (21)

5. DISCUSSION
Repeatable experiments are the keystone of experimental science. In
practice, repeatability depends upon a host of controllable and uncontrollable ingredients, including factors such as stochastic variation, changes
in environmental conditions, difficulties in communicating tacit knowledge
employed by successful experimenters, (44~ and so on. Difficulties in
achieving systematic replication are therefore ubiquitous, from experimental
psychology(21'45) to particle physics. (z3'24/ Of course, this is not to say that
systematic replication is impossible in these or other fields, but it may
appear to be extraordinarily difficult when experiments are considered
individually rather than cumulatively. In the case of the present database,
the authors of a recent report issued by the US National Research Council
stated that the overall results of the RNG experiments could not be
explained by chance, (46) but they questioned the quality and replicability of
the research. This meta-analysis shows that effects are not a function of
experimental quality, and that the replication rate is as good as that found
in exemplary experiments in psychology and physics.
Besides the issue of replicability, five other objections are often raised
about the present experiments. These are (a)the effect is inconsistent with
prevailing scientific models, (b)the experimental methodology is technically naive, thus the results are not trustworthy, (c)the experiments are
vulnerable to fraud by subjects or by experimenters, (d) skeptics cannot
obtain positive results, and (e)there are no adequate theoretical explanations or predictions for the anomalous effect.
These criticisms may be addressed as follows: (a)'Inconsistency with
the scientific world-view' is essentially a philosophical argument that
carries little weight in the face of repeatable experimental evidence, as
suggested by the present and two corroborating recta-analyses. (17'18)

Indeed, if the 'inconsistency' argument were sufficient to discount
anomalous findings, we would have ignored much of the motivation
leading to the development of quantum mechanics. (b)The 'na'fve methodology' argument was empirically addressed by the assessment of
methodological quality in the present analysis. No significant relationship
between quality and effect size was found. (c)Fraud postulated as the
explanation of the results is untenable as it would have required
widespread collusion among 68 independent investigators. In any case,
even severe critics of parapsychological experiments have discounted fraud
as a viable explanation. (32) (d) Skeptics often assert that only 'believers'
obtain positive results in such experiments. However, a thorough literature
search finds not a single attempted replication of the RNG experiment by
a publicly proclaimed skeptic; thus the assertion is not based on verifiable
evidence. Furthermore, skeptics who claim to have attempted replications
insist (without providing details or references) that they have never
achieved positive results in any of their RNG experiments. (15'47) Such a
claim is itself quite remarkable, as the likelihood of never obtaining a
statistically significant result by chance in series of experiments can be
extremely low, depending on the number of experiments conducted. Unfortunately, because we cannot determine how many experiments skeptics
have actually conducted, it is impossible to judge the validity of this
criticism.
Finally, (e)the 'no theoretical basis' argument is correct, but it does
not support a negative conclusion about experimental observation. There
are at present no adequate theories, with the possible exception of some
interpretations of quantum mechanics, ~z3'8'I1~ that convincingly explain or
predict consciousness-related anomalies in random physical systems. We
note, however, that the anomalous effects reviewed in this paper apparently
can be operationally predicted under well-specified conditions. For example, when individuals are instructed to 'aim' for high (or low) numbers in
RNG experiments, it is possible to predict with some small degree of
confidence that anomalous positive (or negative) shifts of distribution
means will be observed.

6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have summarized results of all known experiments
testing possible interactions between consciousness and the statistical
behavior of random-number generators. The overall effect size obtained in
experimental conditions cannot be adequately explained by methodological
flaws or selective reporting practices. Therefore, after considering all of the

<img src="3354157824554.gif" style="float:left" alt="Sometime before entering college in 1922 Thomas Townsend Brown observed that a force is
produced on a Coolidge tube when a high voltage is applied. Since then it has been found that a
force is produced when a high voltage is applied to many other asymmetrical capacitors as well.
Brown received multiple patents in the U.S. and one in Great Britain for his work 1, 2, 3 . This
effect is called the Biefeld-Brown Effect; it was discovered while T. T. Brown was in graduate
school, working under his advisor, Dr. Paul Alfred Biefeld. While it is generally accepted that
such an asymmetrical capacitor produces a thrust, there is not a similar agreement on the
mechanism responsible for the force produced. The purpose of this paper is to provide new test
results and an analysis of those results to resolve this question.
Beginning with the work of T.T. Brown, there is a long history of interest in these devices.
In one configuration, two asymmetrical capacitors are arranged to rotate about a vertical axis.
This device is generally called an Asymmetrical Capacitor Thruster (ACT). Another common
configuration involves one capacitor plate above the other, arranged so the device can lift of the
ground. This device is called a lifter. Alexander de Seversky investigated lifters during the
1960’s with his “Ionocraft” and received a U.S. patent. 4 De Seversky’s craft combined a series
of wires perpendicular to a mesh plate to lift the device.Robert Talley of Veritay Technology 5 performed tests of ACTs in a vacuum in the late
1980’s under Air Force contract. The tests did not let the ACTs spin, but instead suspended it
from a torsion wire. This gave him the sensitivity to be able to measure small forces. His report
is the only written report we have found from the last half-century that describes a measurement
of a force while in a vacuum chamber. Talley ultimately attributed the force that he observed to
the electrostatic interaction between the chamber and the device. Talley wrote, “Direct
experimental results show that under high vacuum conditions... no detectable propulsive force
was electrostatically induced by applying a static potential difference... between test device
electrodes...” Talley concluded (page 91 of his report 5 ), “If such a force still exists and lies
below the threshold of measurements in this program, then the force may be too small to be
attractive for many, if not most, space propulsion applications.” While this work makes a strong
case against the ability of these devices to produce a force in a vacuum, it did not address the use
of asymmetrical capacitors in the atmosphere.
Interest in ACTs and lifters continues today. Jonathan Campbell of NASA’s Marshall Space
Flight Center has designed and tested ACTs that use dielectrics to increase their thrust, receiving
U.S. patents 6,7 for this work in 2001 and 2002. Thomas Bahder and Chris Fazi of the Army
Research Lab (ARL) in Adelphi, MD have recently reported work on the subject 8 . They
constructed multiple devices, both original and reproductions of designs found on the internet
and made qualitative observations. Bahder and Fazi’s paper includes a brief history and an
attempt at an explanation of the cause of the force observed. However, they conclude that “At
present, the physical basis for the Biefeld-Brown effect is not understood.” J.L. Naudin 9 and
others have constructed devices similar to the original Brown patent, and then assembled
multiple devices into larger designs to create “lifters” that perform similarly to de Seversky’s
craft. These designs vary greatly in size and shape; some are multiple cells or have stacked
layers of cells, to create more efficient and more powerful devices.In spite of all of this attention, there is no clear consensus on how a force is produced. There
is a surprising lack of information on this subject in peer reviewed journals. Given this situation,
and the prevalence of speculation from a variety of other sources, we performed an experimental
and theoretical study. Our primary goal was to make careful measurements and to see if they
could be explained by well known physical principles. Our secondary goal was to understand
this device as an “engine” that produces thrust, and to learn how to improve its efficiency.
It should be noted that in sources other than peer reviewed journals, there is a large number
of explanations for the operation of lifters. Some of these explanations suggest that such devices
should work in a vacuum, and many involve mechanisms that seem to violate accepted physical
principles. We took data and developed a simple theory, based on well-known (elementary)
physical principles. The comparison of theory and data was often qualitative, but numerical
simulations were also used. These simulations were designed to elucidate the causes of some
specific features of the experimental data. All of the experimental data was found to be
consistent with the theory and numerical simulations. According to Occum’s Razor, the simplest
explanation is the best. In that context, we note that our model was simple and was based on wellknown physical principles, and it was sufficient to explain all of our data and the data we have
found in the literature.
Some Proposed Theories
The operational characteristics of ACTs and lifters provide some clues as to how they
produce thrust. Various size and shape devices generally require a voltage ranging from a few
kilovolts to 100 kilovolts or more to produce a measurable force. The asymmetry of the devices
is widely accepted as instrumental in allowing a force to be produced. For most designs (but not
for all, as our test data below shows) the direction of the force is independent of the polarity of
the applied voltage, but instead depends on the asymmetry of the capacitor.
Several theories have been proposed to explain the thrust produced by asymmetrical
capacitors. Due to the lack of prior articles in peer reviewed journals explaining this thrust,
proposed theories from a variety of sources will be noted here. These theories involve
mechanisms such as ablative material on the capacitor surface, polarizing the vacuum into matter
and antimatter, and electrostatic forces.
Ablative material will be discussed below. However, as a preview it may be mentioned that
for the velocities of the ejected material that might be expected to result from thermal or
electrostatic forces, the amount of material that would need to be removed is much greater than
that available. The suggestion of polarizing the vacuum into mater and antimatter appears
inconsistent with known physics, since the energy available at the particle level, due to an ACT,
is roughly 9 orders of magnitude too small. These proposed mechanisms are discussed in more
detail under “Theoretical Analysis.”
Another class of theories involves electrostatic forces. A thrust might be produced due to the
charges on the ACT interacting with either charges on nearby bodies or with charges comprising
the leakage current produced by the ACT itself. For example, even in a vacuum chamber, the
ACT might interact with charges induced on the walls of that chamber. Static charges on the
ACT might interact with induced charges on metal or dielectric objects near the chamber. A
related explanation uses the fact that for some configurations the leakage current flows in bursts
called Trichel Pulses 10 . These bursts radiate, and they can create a varying charge on nearby
conductors. It is possible that such a charge might interact with the charge on the ACT, and
produce a force.
In isolation (i.e., in a vacuum) the interaction of the charge on the ACT with its own leakage
current cannot produce a net thrust. Charged particles leaving one plate accelerate and
electrostatic forces transfer momentum to the capacitor. However, when these charged particles
reach the other plate, they transfer the opposite amount of momentum to the capacitor, and there
is no net effect. However, in the atmosphere this can produce a thrust. Ions in the leakage
current undergo multiple collisions with the air before reaching the other plate. These collisions
transfer momentum to the air, and the net effect is that an equal but opposite amount of
momentum is transferred to the ACT. This explanation says that the direction of current flow
(defined as the direction of net positive charge flow) is not as significant as the direction that
charge carriers actually move (regardless of the sign of their charge). This would suggest that">

ACOUSTO-OPTIC (AO) RECEIVER - A SIGINT receiver which process signals using BRAGG CELLs. In these cells, RF signals are converted into acoustic waves which are then sampled with light beams. AO receivers share the positive features of MICROSCAN RECEIVERs, and have good signal probability of intercept (POI). [10:2561]

ACOUSTO-OPTICS - The interaction between sound and light in a crystal. This interaction modifies the light beam's amplitude, frequency, phase and direction, thus processing and revealing information carried by both the sound and the light. Acousto-optics has application in ESM for analysis of low-probability-of-intercept FREQUENCY HOPPING signals. See also BRAGG CELL. [10:29] NOTE: In a typical application, a laser beam is expanded, spatially filtered, and collimated by a set of lenses which direct the beam to a Bragg cell. Concurrently, a transducer on the cell converts the micro-wave signal into an acoustic wave that modulates the light beam, producing a separate beam for each component frequency of the signal and deflecting the beam in proportion to its frequency. A photodetector array detects each beam's position (its underlying frequency), and produces electric output indicating both the frequency and power of each component in the original microwave signal. This rapid signal processing allows accurate measurement of the signal's pulse timing and duration.

ACTIVE DENIAL SYSTEM - A NONLETHAL WEAPON (NLW) that uses pulses of electromagnetic energy to heat the water molecules in a person's skin, causing a painful burning sensation but no actual burning. [10:2883] NOTE: The ACTIVE DENIAL SYSTEM is designed to disperse disruptive crowds as far as 640 meters away without injuring the demonstrators. The radiation can penetrate clothing but will only react with skin to a depth of less than 0.4 mm. These weapons can be either hand-held, vehicle mounted, or mounted on aircraft.

[3] (2) Solid, resonant-size particles dispersed in the atmosphere, and having a high index of refraction. The particles both scatter and absorb visual and laser energy so as to reduce the effectiveness of weapon systems directed by these techniques. [4:1] NOTE: The particle size and type are chosen to scatter or absorb radiation from electro-optical system targets. Some forms of aerosols can partially absorb microwave signals. [8]

AIRBORNE LASER (ABL) - A DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPON (DEW) designed to deliver a lethal LASER beam onto a ballistic missile during the highly vulnerable boost phase of flight. The system autonomously will detect and locate a missile seconds after launch using a series of INFRARED sensors that work in tandem to target the missiles. [10:2589] The ABL consists of three critical laser systems linked by mirrors. The primary mirror both gathers in light beams and focuses them outward; other mirrors reflect the laser beams, split them, sometimes into two separate beams of different wavelengths (diachronic mirrors), steer them, and, for the killing beam, shape its wave front. A megawatt CHEMICAL OXYGEN IODINE LASER (COIL) is the primary killing beam. [10:2607] See also BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE (BMD).

ALL-GAS CHEMICAL LASER - A CHEMICAL LASER which creates its light by combining two specific gases: nitrogen chloride and atomic iodine. The device is expected to be relatively light in weight, operate in zero-gravity environments and possess a built-in heat rejection exhaust. [10:2854]

ANTIMATTER PARTICLE BEAM (APB) - A DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPON (DEW) under DoD's WEAPONS SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES (WST). The generation, propagation and control of antimatter beams of hydrogen or its isotopes. Interaction of the APB with a target consisting of normal matter results in complete annihilation of the beam and an equal amount of normal matter in the target. [www.dtic.mil] NOTE: APBs must be charged to be accelerated, but exoatmospheric beams must be neutralized so that the repulsion of like-charged particles will not spread the beam to a noneffective power density before it reaches the target. APBs potentially have only exoatmospheric, or space, applications because the atmosphere wuld erode them significantly. See also CHARGED PARTICLE BEAM (CPB), GAMMA-RAY LASER (GRASER), HIGH POWER MICROWAVE/RADIO FREQUENCY (HPM/RF), KINETIC ENERGY WEAPON (KEW) and NEUTRAL PARTICLE BEAM (NPB).

ANTI-PERSONNEL BEAM WEAPON (APBW) - A NONLETHAL WEAPON LASER device, similar to the TASER, designed to stun a person or freeze him in his tracks. In place of the TASER's wires to carry the stun charge, the APBW employs two ultraviolet light laser beam to create two charged channels of ionized air that carry the disabling electrical current for a distance of up to 100 meters. [10:2952] See also VEHICLE-DISABLING WEAPON (VDW). NOTE: It is claimed that while the APBW current had a repetition rate sufficiently rapid to tetanize ( Tetanization is the stimulation of muscles fibers at a frequency which merges their individual contractions into a single sustained contraction. ) muscle tissue, it is insufficient to affect the muscles of the heart and diaphragm. In addition, the APBW will not incur retinal damage because the cornea absorbs all the ultraviolet radiation at the wavelengths used. Moreover, the beams are too weak to produce photokeratis ( corneal inflammation ) unless they are directed at the eyes for several minutes. 

ANTIREFLECTION OVERCOAT - A coating of material, such as poly-tetrafluoroethylene, which reduces the reflectance of a material at infrared wavelengths. [10:4] See also RADAR CAMOUFLAGE. 

ANTI-SURVEILLANCE WARFARE - Military action intended to reduce the effectiveness of enemy surveillance operations. [] 

ANTI-TARGETING WARFARE - See COUNTER-TARGETING. 
</div>
ANTI-TRACTION LUBRICANT A NONLETHAL WEAPON consisting of a lubricant applied to roadways which reduces friction of the surface and adversely affects the traction of vehicle wheels and tracks on the treated surfaces such as roads, runways, and tracks. [10:2754] A Teflon-type environmentally neutral lubricant that make footholds or traction exceedingly difficult.

(2) Wires and conduits which are required to enter the Faraday cage must be "bonded" electrically to the protecting mesh to electrically seal the enclosure. An unbonded connection will allow energy to enter and defeat the protective effect of the Faraday cage.

FINGERPRINT - The human fingerprint is comprised of various types of ridge patterns, traditionally classified according to the decades-old Henry system: left loop, right loop, arch, whorl, and tented arch. Loops make up nearly 2/3 of all fingerprints, whorls are nearly 1/3, and perhaps 5-10% are arches. These classifications are relevant in many large-scale forensic applications, but are rarely used in biometric authentication. The fingerprint shown in Figure 1 below is a right loop.


FINGERPRINT CHARACTERISTICS 
 

Referring to Figure 1, the discontinuities that interrupt the otherwise smooth flow of ridges, are the basis for most finger-scan authentication. Codified in the late 1800's as Galton features, minutiae are at their most rudimentary ridge endings, the points at which a ridge stops, and bifurcations, the point at which one ridge divides into two. Many types of minutiae exist, including dots (very small ridges), islands (ridges slightly longer than dots, occupying a middle space between two temporarily divergent ridges), ponds or lakes (empty spaces between two temporarily divergent ridges), spurs (a notch protruding from a ridge), bridges (small ridges joining two longer adjacent ridges), and crossovers (two ridges which cross each other).

Other features are essential to finger-scan authentication. The core is the inner point, normally in the middle of the print, around which swirls, loops, or arches center. It is frequently characterized by a ridge ending and several acutely curved ridges. Deltas are the points, normally at the lower left and right hand of the fingerprint, around which a triangular series of ridges center. 

The ridges are also marked by pores, which appear at steady intervals. Some initial attempts have been made to use the location and distribution of the pores as a means of authentication, but the resolution required to capture pores consistently is very high. []

FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION UNIT (FIU) - A device which can independently enroll, compare, and verify the fingerprint of a finger placed at its sensor. The FIU contains a biometric sensor that can reject phony fingers, duplicate fingerprint images, or other ersatz digits.

GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM (GLONASS) - A Russian small lightweight jammer designed to jam the Global Positioning System (GPS) []

GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) - A constellation of 24 operating satellites and three in-orbit spares (1995). Each satellite continuously emits a pair of signals by which the system's precision and accuracy are achieved. GPS receivers employed by various users can provide positioning accuracy to within centimeters. [10:2573] NOTE: The determining of position of a GPS receiver requires the simultaneous measurement of the distances to four orbiting satellites. The measurement of raw range from a single satellite places the receiver on the surface of a sphere centered on the satellite with a radius equal to the measured range. A simultaneous measurement of the range to a second satellite creates a second sphere that intersects the first and creates a sector upon which the receiver may be found. A third measurement produces the intersection of three spheres with only two points common to all three. One of these points will be in space, the other at the receiver's terrestrial position. In theory, these three measurements should be sufficient to produce an unambiguous positional fix. In practice, however, the inaccuracy of the user's inexpensive clock must be accommodated by a range measurement to a fourth satellite. At this point there are four unknowns -- the user's longitude, latitude and altitude measured from the center of the earth, as well as the bias required to bring the user's clock error into synchronicity with system time and four independent range equations. Solving the system of equations yields user position data to an accuracy of at least 15 meters and time to within 100 NANOSECONDs. [10:2599] There are at least two levels of precision associated with GPS -- Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) code, which involves ionospheric and geoid correction algorithms, and encrypted Precision (P) code, presumably for ballistic missile and other military usage.

Starting at the skin, the uniform is built outward, integrating as many functions as possible. Intended to weigh about 50 pounds, the system will include multi-purpose electronics, including goggles what will allow the soldier to see in both the INFRARED and thermal realms, as well as have a HEAD-UP DISPLAY monocle positioned about 1.5 inches from either eye that will produce a virtual 19-inch color monitor of 800 x 600 pixels. A warning system will be incorporated that will react to a trigger squeeze if the weapon is aimed at a friendly soldier. The helmet will incorporate a GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) , radio, and infrared target designator and locator. The traditional microphone will be replaced by a dime-sized sensor fastened to the head to transmit cranial vibrations to the communications system. System voice control will allow the soldier to control the computer through the microphone. For survivability, the uniform will include vented body armor. Uniform-embedded body sensors will measure the diastolic and systolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, core body temperature and skin temperature - information which will be relayed to field medics so that they can respond to a wounded soldier. Powered tourniquets will be embedded in sleeves and pant legs, and will be capable of being activated with one hand, and operate in a pulsing motions to allow limited blood flow to the limb.

The result is that the person falls to the ground in intense pain, unable to move, while vital functions such as heartbeat and breathing remain unaffected. Recovery takes several minutes. [10:2730] NOTE: E-mail communications from Mr. Wes Thomas point out that tests of the pulse wave myotron do not support the manufacturer's claims. For example, it was claimed that the device can deliver up to 10,000 test bursts, but testing indicates that 4,000 bursts are more likely. Also, Sandia National Laboratories tests (1998) indicate that there is no evidence to support the claim that the device "intercepts and neutralizes brain waves from the motor cortex (voluntary muscle control) and hypothalamic (aggression) regions of the brain." [11.5]

[10:59*] NOTE: UFMOP is an inherent characteristic of high-powered transmitters, and is exploited by ESM for emitter identification. These modulation are due to pushing (frequency, phase or amplitude due to modulation variations in the modulator or power supply), pulling (caused by variations in the load impedance seen by the output tube, such as from a poor rotary waveguide joint), and other effects (shaping of intrapulse characteristics produced by tube warm-up drift, temperature drift and unadjusted high-voltage power supply variations.)

For example, a passenger steps inside, gets a brief blast from 16 air jets, and an overhead analyzer sucks up the human convection plume that naturally exhausts from the human body. After a few seconds, a clean passenger gets a green light to proceed; otherwise, an alarm will sound.

VARIABLE VELOCITY RIFLE SYSTEM (VVRS) - A rifle which vents propellant gas to vary projectile velocity for either lethal or non-lethal effects. [10:2752] See also NONLETHAL WEAPON.

VEHICLE ACTIVE DEFENSE SYSTEM (VADS) - A NONLETHAL WEAPON system consisting of a vehicle equipped with mounted flash, bang, and smoke grenades to distract, allowing the vehicle to then evade ambushers. [10:2745]

VEHICLE-DISABLING WEAPON (VDW) - A NONLETHAL WEAPON system which employs LASER beams to directly inject radio-frequency (RF) electrical current into the electronic circuits of the target vehicle. The disabling current is transmitted through two channels of highly ionized air for a (theoretical) range of up to two kilometers. [10:2952] See also ANTI-PERSONNEL BEAM WEAPON (APBW).

VERTICAL CAVITY SURFACE-EMITTING LASER (VCSEL) - A laser device constructed using ATOMIC-LEVEL MANUFACTURING. The VCSEL is composed of multiple NANOMETER-thick layers of different semiconducting materials that are sandwiched together. The specific wavelength and intensity of the emitting light can be tuned by controlling the spacing between material layers in the fabrication process. [10:2834] NOTE: VCSELs have applications in high-bandwidth, optics-based telecommunications networks.

VIRTUAL-CATHODE OSCILLATOR (VIRCATOR) - A broadband tunable device capable of producing intense electron beams, and therefore suitable for use as a DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPON. [10:16]

VISIBLE LIGHT - ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION which can be detected by the human eye. It is commonly used to describe wavelengths which lie in the range between 0.4 and 0.7 microns. [3] See also ELECTRO-OPTIC, INFRARED, ULTRAVIOLET.

VOICE SYNTHESIS DEVICE - A NONLETHAL WEAPON which has the ability to clone a persons voice so that a synthesized message in that person's voice can be transmitted (e.g., by satellite) to a selected audience. [10:2754]

VOICE TO SKULL (V2K) DEVICE - NONLETHAL WEAPONS which include (1) A NEURO-ELECTROMAGNETIC DEVICE that employs microwave transmission of sound into the skull of persons or animals by way of pulse-modulated microwave radiation. Depending upon the frequency and power densities used, such transmissions may be perceived by humans due to the ELECTROPHONIC EFFECT, which manifests itself as a buzzing or clicking sound in the back of the head. (2) A SILENT SOUND DEVICE which can transmit sound into the skull of person or animals. [] Also called ARTIFICIAL TELEPATHY, MICROWAVE HEARING, FREY EFFECT. NOTE: The sound modulation may be voice or audio sub-liminal messages. One application of V2K is use as an electronic scarecrow to frighten birds in the vicinity of airports.

VORTEX WEAPON - A NONLETHAL WEAPON that generates an explosive charge which creates a massive shock wave traveling at hundreds of miles per hour to its target. [10:2730] NOTE: This weapon can knock down people or even aircraft, and could be used in combination with gases or chemical agents.

WARFIGHTER PHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS MONITORING (WPSM) -- A next-generation combat uniform featuring a configurable array of miniaturized wireless sensors to monitor heart rate, metabolic energy cost of walking or marching, core skin temperatures, and activity or inactivity. The WPSM uniform will also feature GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) geolocation data and a low-power PERSONAL AREA NETWORK (PAN). NOTE: All WPSM data will be transmitted to a central hub device the size of a pager worn on a soldier's belt to be stored or passed on to command communications networks or even the Internet. The WPSM will provide command with information about a soldier's energy expenditure, physiological stress and alertness levels. If a soldier is injured, the sensors will provide medics with the capability to perform accurate battlefield triage. [10:2920] 

WARGAMING THE ASYMMETRIC ENVIRONMENT (WAE) - A Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) Total Information Awareness (TIA) program to develop predictive technology to better anticipate and act against terrorists. Click to view the WAE concept. [10:2969] NOTE: WAE is a revolutionary approach to identify predictive indicators of attacks by and the behavior of specific terrorists by examining their behavior in the broader context of their political, cultural and ideological environment.
