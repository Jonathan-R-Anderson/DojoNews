Many websites have published diagrams purporting to depict Masonic symbolism in the street plan of Washington, D.C.

<p>

Such symbolism generally relates to images of an <a href="../orifice/stone_owl.html" target="_top">owl</a> or an inverted pentagram.

<p>

Some conspiracy theorists point to an upside-down star near the White House, but this star is only an approximation of a true pentagram.  That is, this star is not geometrically accurate (slightly flattened) and does not constitute a true pentagram.

<p>

These explanations are not <a href="http://exemplar-fragmentorum.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.info/uncategorized/illustration/ground-plan-of-globe-theatre/">geometrically rigorous (as the precepts of Freemasonry would demand)</a>.

<p>

What follows is a geometrically rigorous explanation of how Masonic symbolism can be superimposed on the street layout of Washington, D.C.

<p>

<div style="font-size:200%">1.</div>

Here is the Unadulterated Layout of DC:<br>

<div style="font-size:200%">3.</div>

<p>16th street is the  meridian of DC's street layout.  Notice Meridian Hill Park on 16th St. Using that as a central axis, we can see the symmetry inherent in the layout.  Dupont Circle corresponds with Logan Circle, and Washington Circle corresponds with Mt. Vernon Square.  Although the mirror image of New Hampshire Ave is missing, we can superimpose it with a line connecting Logan and Mt. Vernon:</p>

<div style="font-size:200%">4.</div>

Let Point A be the apex of a 72-degree triangle formed by these lines.  72 is significant because it is exactly 1/5th of 360.  Therefore, it naturally forms 1/5th of a pentagon.
<p>
If we use Dupont and Logan as two corners of this pentagon, we can draw several additional figures.

<p>
<p> If we extend the pentagon to construct a pentagram, we get this image:

<div style="font-size:200%">5.</div>

<p>Let the bottom point of the pentagram (where Constitution and 16th Street intersect) be Point B:</p>
<p><br>

<p>


<div style="font-size:200%">6.</div>

<p>If 16th St. is the meridian, the equator would be K St. Let Point C (Center) be the intersection of 16th and K.</p>
<p>Draw Circle 1 around Point C, where the radius of the circle equals the distance to Point A (Apex of 72-degree triangle). The two sqaures that flank the White House fit perfectly in the lower hemisphere of Circle 1.  The lower corners of the lower squares also touch at Point B (16th and Constitution).  Altogether, we get a circle, square, and triangle that  fit together in harmony: <br>

<div style="font-size:200%">7.</div>

Also, Washington Circle, Point B, and Mt. Vernonform a right angle.  Knowing that the right angle is part of the symbol for Freemasonry, we have the symbol superimposed over the city as well, indicating that the Freemasons, naturally, were involved in the design of Washington, DC.

<div style="font-size:200%">8.</div>

Were the Illuminati also involved?  If we see Scott Circle as an eye in the triangle we saw before, we have the Eye in the Pyramid, a symbol of the Illuminati,  also found in the Great Seal on the dollar bill.
