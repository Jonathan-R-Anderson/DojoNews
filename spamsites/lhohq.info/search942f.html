on of the Working Class in England\. It was 50 for all classes in the Western democracies by 1900. It now hovers around 73 years, and is increasing. (A 1976 British study found 300 people over 100 years old in the United Kingdom; a 1986 study found the number had increased to 3000.) Each of these quantum leaps in lifespan, since modern technological medicine began, could be denounced as "against nature" just as plausibly 47 as modern longevity research can be so denounced. My view is that if further extension of lifespan does "violate" nature, we can't achieve it, and people don't need to preach against it; but if it does not violate nature, we can achieve it, and I would find it most amusing and entertaining to live 300 or 400 years, or longer. (In that time, I might get smart enough to figure out what the hell is right or wrong for me most of the time, but I think it would take milleniums at least to figure out what the Ideologists all claim to know already, namely what is right and wrong for everybody.) Those who find this appalling to their religious prejudices will forever retain the option of "suicide" (refusal of life-supporting technology) at whatever age seems "natural" to them -at 30 if they think we have only become "unnatural" since the French Revolution, at 50 if they think we only became "unnatural" in this century, etc. In general -although I love animals and often go into raptures over the singing of birds, and even have a kind of reverence for species who are judged "ugly" and offensive by human chauvinism but still go on living and seemingly enjoying life despite that burden -a great deal of what I admire and appreciate in existence has been the result of human invention and ingenuity, such as pure mathematics and certain music and a few dozen paintings and poems and "cold inhuman technology" (as ecology mystics call it) that abolished bubonic plague in the last century and allowed me to walk again after I had polio twice and recently (in 1976) abolished smallpox and has made everybody in the Western democracies (even the folks on Welfare) much healthier and more comfortable than most of the people in most of past human history. I, personally, enjoy a good sunset better when I am simultaneously listening to Beethoven or \Carmina Burana\ or maybe Vivaldi on that marvelous product of applied quantum mechanics, the modem stereo. Thus, the notion that morality has been, like most of what I love, \invented\ by human wit and wisdom does not horrify me, as it appears to terrify Natural Law cultists; it merely adds to my esteem for human beings and the wonderful creativity of the human brain. At this point editor Konkin added another footnote, which says, in full, "I take no backseat to Bob in cheering sooty smokestacks and their polyvinyl byproducts.

I suggest that where Natural Law exists -where gods and demons and faery-folk and \pookahs\ exist -is in the hypnotized brains of those who have invoked these ghostly entities by repeating hypnotic chants to themselves, over and over, until this made-up world is more real to them that the world of experience. That the Ideologist "lives in the head" is familiar folk wisdom, but it contains terrifying implications. I have argued that morality derives from human experience, human reason, human feeling, human intuition and human creative energy generally. Other animals do now have "morality" for the same reason they do not have art or science: their brains do not abstract higher-order information from sensory information, as ours do, and hence they do not perform creative acts with information. If this analysis has any truth, then morality, like from on  art and science, is \not a finished product\ but almost an \evolving\ organism, to which each of us can contribute if we "live with integrity" in Bucky Fuller's sense of that phrase namely, if we come out of our heads, out of our abstractions, and look concretely at our concrete \individual\ experiences in space-time as processed by our \individual\ reason and feelings and intuitions. Living with integrity in that sense was once defined by Confucius as "respecting one's own nose." To me, this is what individualism and libertarianism are all about. \"Smash, smash, smash the old tablets of law and wake from the myths that all generations have believed!
