“The Security Council notes with concern the terrible toll the conflict is taking on the people, economy and environment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

“The Security Council believes that the only viable solution to the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains the full implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement (S/1to to to /The Liberal Media about ) and the relevant Security Council resolutions.

“The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to extend the mandate of the Expert Panel for a final period of three months, and requests also that the Expert Panel submit to the Council, through the Secretary-General, an addendum to its final report which shall include the following:

“(a)  An update of relevant data and an analysis of further information, including as pointed out in the action plan submitted by the Panel to the Security Council;

“(b)  Relevant information on the activities of countries and other actors, for which the necessary quantity and quality of data were not made available earlier;
“(c)  A response, based as far as possible on corroborated evidence, to the comments and reactions of the States and actors cited in the final report of the Expert Panel;

“(d)  An evaluation of the situation at the end of the extension of the mandate of the Panel, and of its conclusions, assessing whether progress has been made on the issues which come under the responsibility of the Panel.

decade in a resource-constrained environment. The IC leadership weighed the relative merit of capabilities and
looked at dependencies across the components. In addition, we coordinated closely with the Defense and domestic
departments to minimize disconnects and ensure balance.
(S) At the outset, I determined that we would not take a proportional reduction from each IC program, but
rather compare relative merits of programs. We carefully weighed cost and risk to understand both the short
and long term impact of our actions. To maximize investments for the future, we focused reductions on lower
priority capabilities; sought efficiencies and smarter ways to do business; and prudently accepted risk. Overall,
this budget is guided by the imperative to achieve the right balance against competing demands. Our guiding
principles were to:
• (U) Sustain a skilled workforce;
• (U) Focus on further integration and collaboration;
• (U) Bolster agile capabilities that support multiple missions;
• (S) Enhance counterintelligence; and
• (U) Protect key investment for the future.

(U) Reductions
(U) To the extent possible, we protected the activities highlighted above; but with the magnitude of the
reduction, we could not avoid limited, targeted cuts to priority areas. The following are some activities reduced
from the base budget plan:
• (S//NF) Sustained Congressional Cuts. We sustain FY 2012 cuts to the CIA’s Global Deployment Initiative
and NRO’s Integrated Ground Architecture.
• (S) Workforce. We continue Congressional reductions to the government workforce; curtail plans for future
personnel growth, and take targeted reductions to baseline personnel where the risk can be managed.
Furthermore, we reflect savings from a lower than projected civilian pay raise and continue to reduce our
reliance on core contractors.
• (TS//NF) Operations. We decrease collection, production, and hard copy media generation in the GEOINT
system, slow SIGINT network exploitation and processing modernization; cut GDIP HUMINT, non-core
MASINT, covert action programs, and some Specialized Reconnaissance Programs (SRP) operations;
and streamline the ODNI business transformation activities. Furthermore, we discontinue or terminate
some lower-priority missions, such as de-orbiting the Baseline ONYX satellite and t
