 April 2012 list of potential basing locations for DoD drone activities 
inside the U.S. includes Portland, Oregon as a proposed site controlled 
by U.S. Special Operations Command.  A spokesman for USSOCOM told the 
Willamette Week last week that it "does not have nor will it have" a 
drone base in Portland.</p></div>
<p><strong>Public Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>A spokesman for U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has 
provided statements to publications in New Hampshire and Oregon 
indicating that information regarding domestic drone activities provided
 by Public Intelligence is inaccurate, despite confirmations from the 
offices of two U.S. Senators.&nbsp; Following our publication last week 
of a <a href="http://publicintelligence.net/dod-report-to-congress-on-future-uas-operations/">map of current and proposed Department of Defense drone activities within the U.S.</a>,
 several journalists with local publications around the country wrote 
articles regarding drone activities that were listed in their 
area.&nbsp; David Brooks of the Nashua Telegraph <a href="http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/964374-196/military-says-drone-aircraft-based-at-or.html">wrote about the listing of New Hampshireâs Mt. Washington as the site of a USSOCOM drone activity</a> involving small unmanned aerial vehicles including the Raven and Wasp.&nbsp; Corey Pein of the Willamette Week <a href="http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-19348-spying_the_friendly_skies.html">wrote about a planned USSOCOM drone activity in Portland</a> that was listed as utilizing the same types of drones.</p>
<p>When each of these reporters contacted USSOCOM for information on the
 drone activities in their area, a spokesman stated that the information
 provided in our map, which was constructed from several public U.S. Air
 Force presentations from 2010 and 2011, was incorrect.&nbsp; The 
spokesman, deputy public affairs officer Ken McGraw, went so far as to <a href="http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-19348-spying_the_friendly_skies.html">tell the Willamette Week</a> that âU.S. Special Operations Command does not have nor will it have [a drone] base in Portland.â&nbsp; McGraw <a href="http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/granitegeek/964657-440/those-mystery-military-drones-at-mt.-washington.html">provided the Nashua Telegraph with a nearly identical statement</a>
 that USSOCOM âdoes not have a [drone] base in Mt. Washingtonâ and added
 that âUS Special Operations Command does not issue the Raven or Wasp. 
Those two UAVs are Army pieces of equipment.â</p>
<p>Both of the statements provided by USSOCOM have now been found to be 
demonstrably false following further investigation of public documents 
and confirmations of drone activities from the offices of two U.S. 
Senators. In New Hampshire, a local newspaper has <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/article/20120620/NEWS/706209961">now confirmed with the office of Senator Kelly Ayotte</a>
 that in 2010, Navy Special Operations Forces utilized areas around Mt. 
Washington to conduct training operations using Wasp and Raven 
drones.&nbsp; David Brooks of the Nashua Telegraph was further able to <a href="http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/statenewengland/965075-227/pentagon-reports-of-military-drones-near-mt..html">confirm via Army Lt. Col. James Gregory</a> that similar exercises were also conducted in 2009 using the same types of drones.</p>
<p>In Oregon, the Willamette Week was able to <a href="http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-19348-spying_the_friendly_skies.html">confirm with the office of Sen. Ron Wyden</a>
 that drones are currently stored in Portland for several military units
 in the area. Though the location is not primarily used as a launch 
site, the spokesman for Sen. Wydenâs office stated that âin the event of
 a natural disaster or other legitimate needâ drones could be flown out 
of Portland.&nbsp; An <a href="http://publicintelligence.net/dod-report-to-congress-on-future-uas-operations/">April 2012 report to Congress on the DoDâs use of drones</a>
 lists 110 sites around the country that are described as âpotential UAS
 [unmanned aircraft systems] basing locationsâ along with the proposed 
drones that will be flown at each of the locations.&nbsp; The list 
includes several sites in Oregon, including Portland which is 
specifically listed as being under the control of USSOCOM and utilizing 
Wasp, Raven and Puma AE drones.</p>
<p>While some of the confusion surrounding the militaryâs domestic use 
of drones is likely due to terminological issues, such as what 
constitutes a drone base as opposed to an activity, these issues should 
not prevent the military from providing accurate information when 
queried by members of the press.&nbsp; In each of the statements 
provided by USSOCOM, their involvement in domestic drone activities is 
denied or misrepresented, preventing any meaningful exchange from taking
 place.&nbsp; If the military wishes to counter controversy from the 
increasing integration of drones into domestic airspace, then it may 
help to not make statements to press that are inaccurate or disproved by
 publicly available congressional reports.</p>

Syndrome) didn't come from a green monkey that bit a black African on the
ass? Are you lying to us again, Uncle Sam? I think so.
In fact, on July 29, 1969, only days after the Department of Defense (DOD)
asked for $10 million from Congress to fund the development of a “synthetic
biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no
natural immunity could have been acquired . . .' on that day, the chairman
of the Republican Task Force on Earth Resources and Population, the
Honorable George H. W. Bush, U.S. Representative from Texas, 7th District
(1967–71), stressed the pressing need for population control activities to
fend off “a growing Third World crisis.' Imagine.
Here is the linked text of the Dept. of Defense request for Appropriation for
1970, HB 15090, from page 129. Quoted is Dr. MacArthur from said
Pentagon, speaking to Robert L.F. Sikes, Florida, about the need for the
above mentioned “synthetic biological agent' [italics mine].
There are two things about the biological agent field I would
like to mention. One is the possibility of technological surprise.
Molecular biology is a field that is advancing very rapidly and
eminent biologists believe that within a period of 5 to 10 years
it would be possible to produce a synthetic biological agent, an
agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural
immunity could have been acquired.
Mr. Sikes. Are we doing any work in that field?
Dr. MacArthur. We are not.
Mr. Sikes.. Why not? Lack of money or lack of interest?
Dr. MacArthur. Certainly not lack of interest.
Mr. Sikes. Would you provide for our records information on
what would be required, what the advantages of such a
program would be. the time and the cost involved?
Dr. MacArthur. We will be very happy to.
The information follows:
The dramatic progress being made in the field of molecular
biology led us to investigate the relevance of this field of
science to biological warfare. A small group of experts
considered this matter and provided the following observations:All biological agents up to the present time are representatives
of naturally occurring disease. and are thus known by
scientists throughout the world. They are easily available to
qualified scientists for research. either for offensive or
defensive purposes.
Within the next 5 to 10 years. it would probably be possible to
make a new infective microorganism which could differ in
certain important aspects from any known disease-causing
organisms. Most important of these is that it might be
refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes
upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from
infectious disease.
A research program to explore the feasibility of this could be
completed in approximately 5 years at the total cost of $10
million.
It would be very difficult to establish such a program.
Molecular biology is a relatively new science. There are not
many highly competent scientists in the field. Almost all are in
university laboratories. And they are generally adequately
supported from sources other than DOD. However, it was
considered possible to initiate an adequate program through
the National Academy of Sciences - National Research
Council (NAS—NRC).
The matter was discussed with the NAS-NRC. and tentative
plans were made to initiate the program. However. decreasing
funds in CB [chemical-biowarfare]. growing criticism of the CB.
program, and our reluctance to involve the NAS NRC in such
a controversial endeavor have led us to postpone it for the
past 2 years.
It is a highly controversial issue and there are many who
believe such research should not be undertaken lest it lead to
yet another method of massive killing of large populations. On
the other hand, without the sure scientific knowledge that such
a weapon is possible. and an understanding of the ways it
could be done, there is little that can be done to devise
defensive measures. Should an enemy develop it there is little
doubt that this is an important area of potential military
technological inferiority in which there is no adequate . . .
And so on. And thus spake Dr MacArthur. And the $10 million appropriation
was granted. And it worked, perhaps the beginning of the end.
Enter Dr. Robert Strecker
Flash forward to 1983. Dr. Robert Strecker of Los Angeles, a practicing
gastroenterologist with a Ph.D. in pharmacology, is hired as a consultant to
work on a health care proposal for an HMO of the Security Pacific Bank,
concerning coverage costs in the event any of 30,000 employees came
down with AIDS. Along with the help of his brother, Theodore, a lawyer, the
two compiled extensive research of the epidemic which ultimately became
The Strecker Memorandum.
In it, Dr. Strecker indicated that the AIDS virus was in fact developed by the
National Cancer Institute, in cooperation with the World Health Organization
(WHO), in a laboratory at Ft. Dietrick in Maryland. From 1970–74, thislaboratory facility was part of the U.S. Army's germ warfare unit, known as
the Army Infectious Disease Unit, or Special Operations Division, also
referred to as the Army's Chemical Biological Warfare Laboratory. Post
1974, the facility was renamed the National Cancer Institute (NCI).
According to researcher William Cooper (former Navy Intelligence), noted in
Larry Jamison's article Is The AIDS Virus Man Made?, this work was
supervised by the CIA under a project called MK-NAOMI. [To get to this site
click link, then “All News,' then “Next page']
Dr. Strecker has also traced some of the research and researchers at Ft.
Dietrick/NCI to a group of Japanese scientists captured at WW II's end and
given amnesty in exchange for information on racial and ethnic bio-
weaponry, their research dating back to 1930. What's more, expatriated
Russian scientists were brought in to help as well.
Dr. Strecker, one of the original and foremost authorities on the AIDS virus,
found that the virus creation was conducted under the leadership of Dr.
Robert Gallo, who later claimed to discover the virus. Dr. Gallo and his team
created the AIDS virus by combining the bovine (cattle) leukemia virus and
visna (sheep) virus, and injecting them into human tissue cultures.
They discovered, as Strecker did, that bovine leukemia virus is lethal to
cattle, but not to humans. And the visna virus is deadly to sheep, but not to
man. However, when combined, they produce a retro-virus that can change
the genetic composition of the cells they enter. In fact, as Larry Jamison
points out, early field tests on prison convicts led to sickness then death,
which inspired Gallo and friends to bigger and more terrible things, including
injecting brothers and sisters with the tainted vaccine to see who died first.
This was done to study HLA (human leukocyte antigen processing), to see
how related people reacted. Frighteningly, whole families got sick at once!
And there was worse to come.
The AIDS retro-virus works, as Dr. Strecker states, by causing the
destruction of the immune system, fundamentally the body's white blood or
T-cells essential to the effectiveness of the immune system particularly
against opportunistic infections diseases. The B-cells deal with more benign,
bacterial infections. AZT, the drug which is a kind of junk food that starves
the AIDS virus, often kills the patient as well. It provides dubious
consolation.
Predictably, when Robert and Theodore tried to share their findings with
national, state and local authorities, they received only two responses. On
August 11, 1988, Ted Strecker, was found shot to death in his home in
Springfield, Missouri. The death was ruled a suicide, in spite of the fact that
Dr. Robert Strecker had spoken to his brother on the phone the night
before, and Ted was both healthy and in good spirits. On September 12,
1988, the lone political official who had responded to the Streckers' findings,
Illinois State Representative Douglas Huff of Chicago, was found dead in his
home. The autopsy claimed he died of a stroke as a result of an overdose
of cocaine and heroin. Huff had been an outspoken supporter of Dr.
Strecker's work to publicize what was in essence an AIDS cover-up.
Dr. Strecker himself is said to have “gone underground' about five years
ago. Yet copies of his Strecker Memorandum are available on DVD and
VHS. His passion and massive knowledge have not faded since 1988 when
the piece was produced. See it if you can.
The common disinformation on AIDS that Strecker fought was the claim that
AIDS origin came from a green monkey biting a black man's backside in
Africa. Strecker and a number of virologists pointed out that the AIDS virusdoesn't appear naturally in any animal. Plus, it would have been impossible
to reach the point of millions infected from a single episode. More likely,
they said, if the virus had come from green monkeys, it would have surfaced
with the Pygmies, who are closer to them, and use them as a food source.
Ironically, Pygmies contracted AIDS later on when they had intercourse with
prostitutes in cities, where the AIDS virus first appeared, not in the jungle.
Also, concerning green monkeys, Dr. William Campbell Douglass, MD, writes
in 1987 in W.H.O. Murdered Africa : “This is the origin of the green monkey
theory. The polio vaccine was grown on green monkey kidney cells and the
geniuses who brought us polio vaccine said: ‘We got away with it once so
let's use it again.' But they didn't get away with it and in spite of the fact that
polio was rapidly disappearing without any medical intervention, 64 million
Americans were vaccinated with SV-40 contaminated vaccine in the 60s.
An increase in cancer of the brain, possibly multiple sclerosis and God only
knows what else is the tragic result. The delay between vaccination and the
onset of cancer with this virus is as long as 20–30 years. Ninteen sixty-five
plus 20 equals 1985. Get the picture?'
Why, Where and When the AIDS Epidemic First Reared its Head
In 1972, under the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO), there
was a massive vaccination program for smallpox, literally for millions of
Africans. Strecker and others believe that the smallpox vaccine laced with
the HIV/AIDS virus was given the population, which was mostly black, poor,
and part of that startlingly growing African population that GHW Bush,
among many elites, the Rockefeller family, the Club of Rome crowd and
Bilderbegers, had been concerned with in 1969, and back to 1965, when
“the Club' was formed. The intent was to achieve their awful goal—of
reducing the world's population by 75 percent—as mentioned in The Modern
History Project. This is the main reason the AIDS pandemic occurred almost
simultaneously in Haiti, Brazil, Japan, and the United States, as well as
Central Africa.
As Jamison tells us, “There was a book in 1968 titled The Population Bomb,
by Dr. Paul Ehrlich that had a very telling paragraph on page 17 that
probably tells us the key thinking that was behind the decision. Dr. Ehrlich
says ‘in summary, the world's population will continue to grow as long as
the birth rate exceeds the death rate; it's as simple as that. When it stops
growing or starts to shrink, it will mean that either the birth rate has gone
down or the death rate has gone up or a combination of the two. Basically,
then there are only two kinds of solutions to the population problem. One is
a birth rate solution (remember the ZPG—Zero Population Growth—
movement?) The other is a death rate solution in which ways to raise the
death rate—war, famine, pestilence—find us. The problem could have been
avoided by population control, in which mankind consciously adjusted the
birth rate so that a ‘death rate solution' did not have to occur.'' How
thoughtful of them all.
Jamison goes on to say: “The late William Cooper, in his excellent book
Behold A Pale Horse notes that Dr. Ehrlich's wife, Anne, is a member of the
Club Of Rome, a think tank group that produced a computer model called
Global 2000 which not only outlined the recommendations for AIDS,
including a special prophylactic for the ruling elite, and a cure at the very
same time which is to be released to the survivors when it is decided
enough people have died. According to Cooper, the Global 2000 plan was
developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then presented
to President Carter. Cooper's research determined that the order to proceed
with the plan ‘was given by the policy committee of the Bilderberg Group in
Switzerland.''He adds, “The Bilderbergers . . . are a powerful alliance of elite world
political leaders and international financiers. . . . In his book, Cooper also
mentions the ‘Haig-Kissinger depopulation policy which has taken over
various levels of government and in fact is determining U.S. Policy. The
planning organization operates outside the White House and directs its
entire efforts to reduce the world's population by 2 billion people through
war, famine and any other means necessary.' Active policies of our State
Department go beyond the implementation of AIDS, because Cooper
mentions the existence of the office of Population Affairs whose Latin
American case officer Thomas Ferguson actually made the statement that
‘There is a single theme behind all of our work: we must reduce population
levels. Either they do it our way through nice clean methods or they will get
the kind of mess that we have in El Salvador, or in Iran or in Beirut.'' That
‘messy and clean' language has a familiar ring to it.
And in fact, on May 11, 1987, as The Modern History Project, Jamison, and
others point out, no less than the London Times broke the story “Smallpox
Vaccine ‘Triggered AIDS Virus.'' It was written by Science Editor Pearce
Wright, who, challenged by independent investigators' research, went on to
tie the World Health Organization's mass vaccination program to the AIDS
outbreak. Since Central (Sub-Saharan) Africa was the locus of the program,
it has tragically become the most hard-hit area of the world. The London
Times article, which spread like wildfire over Europe, never touched the
shores of America. The story was buried like the first AIDS victim.
The irony is that AIDS is considered a heterosexual disease in Africa, while
in America it has been stigmatized as a ‘gay' disease. The dark heart of that
matter begins in 1969, with a Dr. W. Schmugner, a Polish physician
educated in Russia, who came to America where he became head of the
New York City Blood Bank. He established guidelines for a Hepatitis B
vaccine study, in which only “promiscuous males,' ages 20 to 40 were
included in the study, managing to somehow single out only gays.
In 1978, more than a thousand “promiscuous homosexual' males were the
victims of this “experimental' Hepatitis B vaccination, sponsored by the
National Institute of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
Since the vaccine was not produced from human tissue culture, it's
impossible to have an accidental contamination. In plain language, the AIDS
virus was intentionally laced into the Hep B vaccine. By 1981, the CDC
claimed that only 6 percent of the Hep B vaccine recipients were infected
with AIDS. In 1984, the truth was outed: the number was 64 percent. That's
right, 64 percent. Not surprisingly, these Hep B vaccines studies are now
under lock and key at the No Justice Department in Washington, DC. And
no one can see them. No, no, no, not you, not you, not you.
Helping to Further Spread the Disease
To help the disease really dig into the population, vital information was
additionally covered-up. Emphasis was put on the prime cause of AIDS
infection as the exchange of body fluid through sexual activity and
intravenous drug use. This gave birth to a campaign for using clean unused
needles as well as condoms. Lovely. The fact is condom use is not a
guarantee against contracting the disease. One AIDS virion (a virus particle
with outer coat intact) is 500 times smaller than the smallest sperm and 10
times smaller than the smallest hole in a condom and therefore can pierce
it. Failure rates of 30–50 percent have been noted, and condom quality itself
is under scrutiny. Nevertheless, this is not, I repeat, not a recommendation
to anyone not to use a condom.
What's more, the risk of casual contact has been understated. I don't meanto anger anyone here or bail on the afflicted, but AIDS is highly contagious.
There is hard evidence, which Strecker mentioned, that the AIDS virus can
survive on a dry petri dish for 7 days, and up to 15 days in a wet
environment. Incubation in a host can last for 10 to 15 years before there is
noticeable sign of illness. This means a carrier could unknowingly pass on
the disease in that time. It's a painful proposition all around, including the
caution of Professor William Haseltine of Harvard Medical School: “Anyone
who tells you categorically that AIDS is not contracted by saliva is not telling
you the truth. AIDS may in fact be transmissible by tears, saliva, bodily
fluids, and mosquito bites.'
Whether you agree with the above or not, the larger context is that this pox,
this abomination, was created and spread consciously by the United States
government against black heterosexual populations and then gay white
populations, and then spread to populations at large around the world. This
mass-murder has already dwarfed the holocaust, in which six million people
were murdered with industrial technology. The evil geniuses behind this
virus have bio-engineered an organism that multiples 100 times faster than
influenza. There are more than 180 different AIDS viruses and 300 strains,
which makes blood testing meaningless. Strecker's number for possible
AIDS viruses was 9,000 (base pairs on the genome) to the fourth power.
In Conclusion for Now
The notion of a single vaccine to deal with all the permutations is
impossible, according to Strecker, Dr. Campbell Douglass, and other
doctors. What's more, UN statistics, to the extent that they can be trusted,
approximate that:
People living with HIV number 39.4 million . . .
New HIV infections in 2004 were 4.9 million . . .
Deaths due to AIDS in 2004 were 3.1 million . . .
Avert.Org puts the total number of people living with AIDS at 39.4 million.
Concerning total AIDS deaths, Dr. Campbell Douglass writes: “Dr. Strecker
points out that even if the African green monkey could transmit AIDS to
humans, the present known amount of infection in Africa makes it
statistically impossible for a single episode, such as a monkey biting
someone on the butt, to have brought this epidemic to this point [1987]. The
doubling time of the number of people infected, about every 14 months,
when correlated with the first known case and the present known number of
cases, prove beyond a doubt that a large number of people had to have
been infected at the same time. Starting in 1972 with the first case from our
mythical monkey and doubling the number infected from the single source
you get only a few thousand cases. From 1972 to 1987 is 15 years or 180
months. If it takes 14 months to double the number of cases then there
would have been 13 doublings, one then 2, then 4, then 8, etc. In 15 years,
from a single source of infection there would be about 8,000 cases in Africa,
not 75 million. [That's his bottom line then for Africa alone] We are
approaching World War II mortality statistics here—without a shot being
fired.'
Thus, we are faced with a species-killer, a global war on humanity, silently
out-pacing anything but all-out nuclear conflagration. To those of us in
North America, to those of us who are healthy (we hope), these figures, this
plague, seem distant often, happening to others, a subject already talked todeath. Unless light can continue to be shed on AIDS soon, even from some
dark figure among those who perpetuated it, where is the future and how do
we take life today for granted tomorrow? In the haze of a television culture,
of endless ballgames, “reality' shows, sitcoms, apocalypse movies, and
romantic comedies, where is the light? AIDS was man made in the USA,
and is not God's wrath on gays, Africans, Latinos, or women, as various
crackpots would have us believe. AIDS is about all of us and our
generations surviving the crass dementia of some ruling class. Like the
virus, the enemy is within the social body, feasting on it. It's time, one way
or the other, to turn this dark light and its ops out.
