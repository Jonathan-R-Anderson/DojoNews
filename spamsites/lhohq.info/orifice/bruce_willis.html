The Network Architecture Of Treason Submitted by lambert on Sat, 2005-12-24 23:14. [it's nice to be right.] By carefully examining how Republicans parse  their statements about Bush's warrantless, openly felonious, and treasonous[1] domestic surveillance program, and  combining that with network engineering knowledge available through open sources,  alert reader philosophicus has advanced our understanding of the NSA surveillance  system Bush set up. Long story short: (1) Internet surveillance is Bush's goal, not voice calls; (2) the Republican "wiretap" talking point is a diversion, to voice, away from from Internet surveillance; (3) Bush's domestic surveillance system would pose no engineering challenges whatever to NSA. No rocket science‹or tinfoil hats‹required. In a future installment of this series, we'll look at the text mining component of this program, assess its impact, and see whether it's going to work (no). Read on: [Portions of part 1 were originally published on Talk Left (with many good  comments), and mentioned here, and implicitly here; links have been added here. Parts  2 and 3 are new. The indented portions of what follows are from philosphicus; the  unindented framing is from Corrente. We solicit your feedback.] Part 1: The Internet is Bush's target, not voice Let us Parse: Why, in his handwritten letter, does Rockefeller state that he's "not a technician."?

<a href="../busch_foto/soupcan.html">Why the mention of TIA in Rockefeller's letter? Why does Gonzales keep mentioning "changes in technology" as a  dodge around FISA? What does Condi mean when she says "communicate in much more fluid ways"? What's the "technology" and "hot numbers" Cheney talks about?</a> Why this seemingly inconsequential parsing by Bush of the difference between "monitoring and detection"? Bush says they use FISA if they're monitoring, but this is about "detection." And why the mention of "large batches of numbers all at once"? Why? Why? Because they're really not talking about voice‹as one might think, hearing the word "wiretap." They're talking about data. These are  IP addresses; email addresses (Note that the Times article that (very belatedly) revealed this program is careful to add the phrase "and email" throughout, whenever phone calls are mentioned.) We believe that Bush, through the NSA, has put a system in place that, in essence, filters Internet traffic on certain triggers (text, phoneme, etc.) within Internet "conversations." This is "detection" in Bush's mind. "Monitoring" would be recording an entire conversation, like in a phone conversation. This is the technology Cheney, Condi, Gonzales and Bush  are talking about, that didn't exist when FISA was drafted. In part 3 of this post, philosophicus will outline the network architecture; and in a subsequent post, the "triggers." For now, let's look at why the Republican "wiretap" talking point is so pernicious. Part 2: The Republican "wiretap" talking point is a diversionary tactic "Wiretap" is a talking point that really

emonstrate to the FISA court that the communications are relevant to its investigation. Nor can the court deny the FBI's request; if the FBI certifies the tap is "for" such an investigation, the FISA court must issue the order. That Section 214 lowered the standard for FISA pen-traps is even more disturbing in light of the fact that PATRIOT Section 216 expanded their reach. Unlike regular wiretaps issued under much stricter standards, pen-traps aren't supposed to collect the actual content of your communications, such as what you say on the telephone. Instead, they capture "non-content" information about your communications, such as the telephone numbers that you dial or the numbers of people who call you. Before PATRIOT, the statute defined pen registers and  trap-and-trace devices solely in the context of telephone  communications. But Section 216, which does not sunset,  expanded the pen-trap definition to include devices that monitor Internet communications, without clarifying what portions of Internet communications are "content," requiring a full wiretap order, versus "non-content," which can be legally acquired only with a pen-trap order. At the  very least, this change means that the government can use  a pen-trap to see the email addresses of people youÕre sending email to and the addresses of people who send  email to you, along with the timestamp and size in bytes of  each email. The FBI can monitor the IP addresses of all the  computers you interact with over the Internet, or capture  the IP addresses of every person visiting a particular  website. Under the vaguely written statute, it may even be  able to capture the URL of every web page that you read,  although the FBI refuses to confirm or deny whether it has  done so. Anytime anyone in the administration says that everything remains the same with "wiretaps", they are parsing  words. This has nothing to with "wiretaps." "Wiretap," in common usage, is a term of art referring to analog communications. But in above section of the Patriot Act as drafted, it refers to Internet monitoring. 1. So why did Bush not get the warrants needed retroactively? I believe that the law was drafted in haste by lawyers and staff who had only a cursory knowledge  of the technology. Once this was put into operation and the administration saw  the result (e.g. 9,000 traffic flows with 18000 IP addrs) the career DOJ guys  freaked. They probably registered their opinion which got deep-sixed by the  administration and was probably leaked and sitting in the NYTimes safe, still  unpublished. I believe we have some recent precedent for that. 2. Part 3: Bush's domestic surveillance system would pose no engineering challenges whatever to NSA.

 metrics. More recently, packet inspection techniques have been  applied by the major ISPs to thwart Denial of Service attacks, worms. and  so on. So, we know where the chokepoints to monitor are (step 1). We're know how much capacity we need to monitor the checkpoints (step 2). And we know that there's proven technology to monitor the checkpoints (step 3). On the cheap. Part 4: If we had such a system in place, what would we monitor? So how does one spot a DoS attack or worm? Simply by recognizing a pattern or signature in the traffic. What is the difference between a  malicious pattern and a certain set of words in an email or an http flow?  To the computer, no difference. To humans, semantics (or semiotics,  depending on your philosophy.) Somebody decides which patterns of  words are malicious or evil. Hey! I wonder who does that? Next up: What shall we do with all this data? Munging on the cheap. Corrente thanks alert reader philosophicus for the analysis. We think he puts all the pieces together an an original and interesting way. (And of course the crazy, not indented stuff is all Lambert, who may, or may not, have fully recovered from his  fever.) Thanks also to Leah for edits and holding the fort. It takes a village to stomp a  weasel. UPDATE: Welcome, Daou Report readers. UPDATE: Note well that philosophicus is defining the scale and scope for this  surveillance system, and concludes it can be done with $1000 off-the-shelf rack  servers. This system doesn't have to be Echelon at all. That's old news. In fact, since the Bush administration likes to bypass existing institutions, it probably is

sits up and works for the Republicans, because in this context, it confuses the exact issue they want to confuse. To the casual reader, wiretap suggests voice, like the FBI planting a bug in a Mafia don's phone. However, because of the way that the Patriot Act was drafted, "wiretap" can be construed to mean Internet communication. Let's look at the EFF's analysis of the Patriot Act: Before the PATRIOT Act, the government could only get a FISA pen-trap order when the communications to be monitored were likely to be either (1) those of an international terrorist or spy or (2) those of a foreign power or its agents relating to the criminal activities of an international terrorist or spy. PATRIOT 214 threw out this requirement. Now, any innocent person's communications can be tapped with a pen-trap so long as it is done "for" an intelligence investigation.
