Project
provides the technological means for NSA/CSS to gain access to and
securely return high value target communications. By concentrating on
the means of communication, the network itself, and network links
rather than end systems, OTN research manipulates equipment
hardware and software to control an adversary's network. Research is
conducted at the Laboratory for Telecommunications Sciences in
College Park, MD, and supports the evolving NSA/CSS internal
information infrastructure and the larger IC.{...}
(U) Base resources in this project are used to:
{...}
• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Continue research of quantum
communications technology to support the development of novel
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) attacks and assess the security
of new QKD system designs.
