The woman said that one of the soldiers contacted her a few months after the bathtub incident and told her Mr. Spence had shown pictures of them having sex to the soldier's wife and that it led to a separation.

The soldier told her that Mr. Spence initially blackmailed him into "beating up a couple guys" to keep his wife from finding out, she said. But Mr. Spence "burned him anyway" because the soldier refused to have sex with him, the woman said.

SPENCE ELUSIVE, SAID TO BE EVERYWHERE BUT ISN'T

Where in the world is Craig Spence?

A lot of people say they know, but the sightings of Mr. Spence, the mysterious Washington lobbyist who wined and dined the city's power elite while patronizing a call-boy ring now under U.S. investigation, so far are as reliable as the sightings of Elvis.

He (Mr. Spence, not Elvis) was seen on a bus at with another th and P streets last week.

Or the flamboyant Washington influence peddler recently made several appearances at a Georgetown disco - sans cape.

Or the man the U.S. Secret Service has sought - apparently unsuccessfully - to answer questions about midnight tours of the White House, is hiding out in a friend's New York City apartment.
