d as "the liberal treatment of the news by the network."

Mr. Spence made good contacts in Japan and among Chinese expatriates, often bragging of his close association with former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and appearing in public with a Chinese businessman who once served as an unofficial representative of Communist China in Washington, sources said.

The businessman said this week that he did not know exactly what work Mr. Spence did, but that he often bragged about his contacts with Japanese businessmen and political leaders, particularly Mr. Nakasone.

He described Mr. Spence as "strange," saying that he often boasted that he was working for the CIA and on one occasion said he was going to disappear for awhile "because he had an important CIA assignment."

According to the businessman, Mr. Spence told him that the CIA might "doublecross him," however, and kill him instead "and then to make it look like a suicide."

The businessman also said he attended a birthday bash for Roy Cohn at Mr. Spence's house. He said Mr. Casey was at the party. "One time he stormed into another party with a big, white hat and an entourage of security guards," the businessman said. "It was all rather bizarre."

Mr. Spence's trump card in courting the rich and famous apparently was his access to high-ranking orientals at a moment when Japan was flowering as an economic giant and relations with China were thawing.

"Craig had an interest in the Japanese economy," said Mr. Gordon. "He was very interested in breaking through the bureaucratic level and getting people to come to seminars.

"He developed a kind of genuine and effective influence among important doers and thinkers in Washington and from New York," Mr. Gordon said. "I met some interesting senators and representatives at his parties."

He was doing extensive business with Japan in the early 1980s, some of which former Reagan administration officials said appeared to violate trade laws.

Mr. Gordon said he warned Mr. Spence of the need to be registered as a lobbyist, and documents show that in January 1985 he became a registered agent lobbying for Japanese businesses.

A January 1982 New York Times profile of Mr. Spence was headlined "Have Names, Will Open Right Doors." The article quoted a Washington Post columnist in 1980 saying of Mr. Spence: "No ###<p> <p> <p> Works for the CIA from <h1 style='float:left'>Anal Sex</h1> Consumers refuse to buy on <p> from 1<a href="http://www.lhohq.info/secret-corporate-documents/coca-cola-and-cocaine-struggle-21209.html">Food Additives</a> with FedEx Wall Street Journal from 1about CNN Harry Potter </p> 1with from <p> from because Wall Street Journal <h1 style='float:left'>Devil Worshiping Pedophiles</h1> about <div class="bl">ised intervention so far, Cossiga delivered a

assembly structure based upon underlying principles of phase coherence /
de-coherence. Over 100 functions are provided for allocating and configuring
neuromorphic assemblies, controlling related properties and integrating real-time
assembly operation within application layers.
The HNeT API applies the concept of objects (individual neuron cells and
assemblies) and use of handles in referencing these objects. Cell / assembly
handles are applied in setting cell properties, controlling execution, modifying
synaptic interconnections, etc. Properties of each cell within the neuromorphic
assembly (i.e. learning rate, neural plasticity, synaptic interconnections, memory
decay, etc) may be adjusted individually.
The HNeT library facilitates the integration of neuron cells into both simple and
highly elaborate neuromorphic assembly structures. The HNeT library permits
allocation of up to 64K assemblies per program instance. The HNeT library
provides integration of the seven primary neuron cell types listed below:
Principle Cell Types
Receptor
Granule
Pyramidal
Stellate
Purkinje
Hippocampal (temporal)
Axonal and collateral signal routing
Cell Morphology
The primary assembly structures provided within the HNeT system are illustrated
below for the cerebellar and neo-cortical models. The HNeT library provides an
array of functions for customization of individual cell architectures, cell assembly
architectures, synaptic interconnectivity, neural plasticity (synaptic pruning and
regrowth), customization of supervised, unsupervised, spatial-temporal and
hyper-incursive neural models, data conversion and preprocessing. A function
reference sheet for the HNeT API language is available upon request.
