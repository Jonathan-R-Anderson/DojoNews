ass media coverage of him starting last summer that, over a
short period of time, became continuous and unavoidable.

The duress had prevented me from starting litigation before this year. However, as soon as I
surfaced, I received threats. More specifically, shortly after my first complaint was filed in California on
April 26, 2016, I started receiving threatening phone calls on a cell phone I then owned. The calls were
never for more than 20 seconds or so before they hung up and they were always from a blocked or
unavailable phone number according to my caller ID feature. Since I changed phone numbers, the
threatening calls have completely stopped.
12.
This litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and I believe
that identification of me would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to me and to others.
13.
I have no reason to believe that the Defendants' threats have ever been lifted or will ever be
lifted and so I request that the Court issue an order protecting me and my family from harm and
harassment by the Defendants.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Certain of the public service corporations, Dru insisted, should be
taken over bodily by the National Government and accordingly the
Postmaster General was instructed to negotiate with the telegraph and
telephone companies for their properties at a fair valuation. They were
to be under the absolute control of the Postoffice Department, and the
people were to have the transmission of all messages at cost, just as
they had their written ones. A parcel post was also inaugurated, so that
as much as twelve pounds could be sent at cost.



CHAPTER XXXIV

SELWYN'S STORY


The further Administrator Dru carried his progress of reform, the more
helpful he found Selwyn. Dru's generous treatment of him had brought in
return a grateful loyalty.

One stormy night, after Selwyn had dined with Dru, he sat contentedly
smoking by a great log fire in the library of the small cottage which
Dru occupied in the barracks.

"This reminds me," he said, "of my early boyhood, and of the fireplace
in the old tavern where I was born."

General Dru had long wanted to know of Selwyn, and, though they had
arranged to discuss some important business, Dru urged the former
Senator to tell him something of his early life.

Selwyn consented, but asked that the lights be turned off so that there
would be only the glow from the fire, in order that it might seem more
like the old days at home when his father's political cronies gathered
about the hearth for their confidential talks.

And this was Selwyn's story:--

My father was a man of small education and kept a tavern on the outer
edge of Philadelphia. I was his o
