Brooks believed Gatlin's frequent world travels were as a 'transporter' for the CIA... The search for Gatlin, however, was likewise futile: in 1to from on  he fell or was pushed from the sixth floor of the El Panama Hotel in Panama during the early morning, and was killed instantly." Guy Banister is claimed by another researcher, as I previously mentioned, to have been undercover for Division Five of the FBI at the time he ran the detective agency in New Orleans. As Turner goes on to note, about Works for the CIA  Lafayette and </p> on  Camp are two entrances to the same building. Located next to Waterbury's Drugs, at the corner of Camp and Canal, it stands at the other end of a very short block at Camp and Lafayette. As for David Ferrie who, according to Jerry Brooks, frequented Banister's office, I met him very briefly and casually once at a party and, as I've mentioned already, I met Guy Banister one evening in the Bourbon House. What of Maurice Brooks Gatlin, though? Notice that Jerry Brooks claimed this man trusted him and also seemed unaware of his death four years earlier in Panama. Going with my assumption that Jerry Milton Brooks could have been Slim Brooks, and with my further assumption would be that Gary Kirstein, Slim's alleged Brother-in1another another  law, was actually E. Howard Hunt using another man's name, a fascinating hypothesis suggests itself. According to Torrbit's thesis, the CIA's Double-Check Corporation of Miami was on loan to Division Five for anti-Castro activities, and both were involved in the Cuban Revolutionary Council headquartered in Banister's office. In that case, Banister almost certainly would have known and could have been working with E. Howard Hunt. Suppose that with Brooks, Hunt was using a false identity – that of Maurice Brooks Gatlin. Then it is easy to imagine how Slim could have become involved in the assassination plot. Moreover, Slim continued to meet with Brother-in-law in the years that followed, which would explain why Jerry Milton Brooks seemed unaware of the death of Gatlin. Either the real Gatlin, whose name Hunt was using, or another individual on assignment with the Gatlin ID, could have been murdered in Panama shortly after the John Kennedy murder in order to dispose of an identity Hunt no longer needed. Banister is dead. Ward, whoever he was, is dead. And Maurice Gatlin is dead or never existed and is presumed dead. E.
