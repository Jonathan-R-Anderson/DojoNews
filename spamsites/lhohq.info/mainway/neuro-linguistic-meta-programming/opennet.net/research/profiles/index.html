big businesses for small businesses you destroy the old intimate
connection which formerly existed between masters and men, it would
appear to be necessary, if you wish to maintain the old friendly
relations between employer and employed, that you should establish your
business on lines which will automatically create a feeling of loyalty
on the part of all concerned to the industry with which they are
connected.

How is that to be done? By co-partnership.

Now, what is the ideal of co-partnership?

Ideal co-partnership is a system under which worker and consumer shall
share with capitalists in the profits of industry.


THE SURPLUS PROFITS GO TO CAPITAL.

Under our present system the whole of the surplus profits go to capital,
and it is the object of capital to give the worker the least wage for
which he will consent to work, and to charge the consumer the highest
price which he can be persuaded to give; conversely it is the object of
labor to give as little as possible for the wage received.

Now, that is a system which cannot possibly satisfy the requirements of
a civilized and well-organized society. What we want is a system which
will safeguard the consumer, and also provide the worker with a
natural, self-compelling inducement to help the industry with which he
is connected. That system is provided by co-partnership. Co-partnership
insists that the workers have a right to participate in the net profits
that may remain after capital has received its fixed reward. In a co-
partnership business, just as the reward of labor is fixed by the trade
union rate of wages, so the reward of capital is fixed by the amount
which it is necessary for the industry to give. That amount will vary
corresponding with the security of the risk attending the industry in
question. If the industry is a safe one, it will be
