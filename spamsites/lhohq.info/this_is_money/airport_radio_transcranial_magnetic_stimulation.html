EDISON MISLA ALDORANDO, Speaker of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, reached a deal with prosecutors to reduce a rape charge to attempted rape of his 17 year-old step daughter and her friend.

FL STATE REP. BOB ALLEN (R-Merrit Island) was arrested on July 11, 2007 and charged with soliciting an undercover male officer for oral sex at a park in Central Florida.

Married with a wife and child, Allen, is a former Little League volunteer who also donated time to the Boys and Girls Club, serving on its board of directors.


RANDAL DAVID ANKENEY, a Republican activist and regional representative for Colorado Governor's Office of Economic Development, was considered a fixture in El Paso County Republican politics. He was charged with sexual assault on a child with force, sexual assault on a child, sexual exploitation of a child, marijuana possession, and possession of drug paraphernalia, but copped a plea to a lesser crime of attempted sexual assault. The girl was 13 years old at the time. In addition, he was charged in the sexual assault of a 17 year-old campaign worker. Oh yeah, his dogs were named Nixon and Reagan.


JIM BAKKER, PTL Club televangelist, committed adultery with Jessica Hahn and then used charitable donations to pay her hush money. His finely-tuned Ponzi scheme bilked his followers out of millions of dollars. He was indicted on 23 federal charges of fraud, tax evasion, and racketeering. But Bakker did repent and was forgiven by the Lord. However, God does not forgive Democrats for similar offenses.  


PAUL ROBERT BALACH was Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole's political personnel liaison to the White House. He was also an aide to Rep. Robert Bauman (listed above - Birds of a feather DO flock together). Balach was part of a major White House scandal during the 1980's. Children from orphanages in Nebraska were transported around the United States by top Republican officials in order to engage in child sex orgies with America's ruling elite. Balach paid for homosexual prostitute services which were charged to his credit card. See Charles K. Dutcher, Lawrence E. King, Jr. & Craig J. Spence.


REP. BOB BARR (GA) sponsored the anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act, believes in the sanctity of marriage, and is an opponent of abortion. Yet. Rep. Barr was married three times.

While married to his third and present wife, Barr was photographed at a charity event licking whipped cream from the chests of two buxom women .

According to its web site, the group describes itself as Oregon's leading grassroots organization defending our Godly heritage, and is affiliated with the national organization founded by Pat Robertson. Beres was accused by three of his female family members of molesting them when they were pre-teens. Some heritage!  


JOHN BOLTON, Bush's back-door appointee ambassador to United Nations, has set about trying to single-handedly dismantle the U.N. There are corroborated allegations that Mr. Bolton's first wife, Christina Bolton, was forced to engage in group sex have not been refuted by the State Department.  


HOWARD L. BROOKS, legislative aide and former director of the Antelope Valley YMCA, was charged with molesting a 12-year old boy and possession of child pornography.  


ANDREW BUHR, the Republican party nominee for the Missouri House in 2000 and the former Republican committeeman for Hadley Township, was one of three men charged with two counts of first degree sodomy with a 13-year old boy. After his arrest, GOP Central Committee Chairman John Winston called Buhr 'a nice guy, and a smart person who was very active in the party.'  


TED BUNDY campaigned for the Republican Party, and was considered by many as a rising star in the GOP. He was also a serial rapist who murdered 16 women.  


JOHN ALLEN BURT, an anti-abortion extremist, was charged with sexual misconduct involving a 15-year old girl. He was caught by police 150 miles from the scene of the crime, obviously trying to make his escape. The girl, one of two who have brought about allegations against Burt, was living at Our Father's House, Burt's home for unwed mothers. The home was accredited and inspected by the Florida Association of Christian Childcare Agencies. Burt has a long history in connection with violence against abortion clinics.  


REP. DAN BURTON (IN), Chairman of the House International Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, a staunch Conservative and Born-again Christian, was quoted as saying that character does matter. He once deemed President Clinton a scumbag for his sexual encounters while in office. Yet, Burton admitted committing adultery and fathering an illegitimate child. In addition, it has been reported that Burton abused his power by using strong-arm and unethical campaign finance practices and by preying on female lobbyists, staffers and constituents. Furthermore, it is alleged that he groped a lobbyist from Planned Parenthood in the mid-1990s when she visited his Washington office. There are also accusations that Burton maintained sexual relationships with women on his congressional and campaign payrolls.    


PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH was accused in a criminal complaint and lawsuit of raping Margie Schoedinger, who later mysteriously committed suicide. Tammy Phillips, a former stripper, claimed she had an affair with Bush that had ended in 1999.    


JOHN BUTLER, Cass County, IL, GOP chairman, was charged with criminal sexual assault on a teenage girl. Butler had previously received pardons from Gov. George Ryan for burglary convictions.  


REP. KEN CALVERT (CA), champion of the Christian Coalition, was quoted as saying 'We can't forgive what occurred between the President and Lewinsky.' Yet in 1993, this champion of family values was caught by police in a compromising position with prostitute in a parked car. He then attempted to flee the scene. Not surprisingly, Calvert was accused by his ex-wife of being a deadbeat dad.    


REP. HELEN CHENOWETH (ID) admitted to a six-year adulterous affair with a married associate. In 1995, Chenoweth had denied the affair when asked about it by The Spokane Spokesman-Review, but she claimed a pardon from a higher authority: 'I've asked for God's forgiveness, and I've received it,' she revealed. Like Bush, she also speaks to God. In other words, God is far more forgiving of Republican moral offenses than Democrats.  


KEOLA CHILDS Interesting last name for a pedophile, Hawaii County Councilman pleaded guilty to first degree sexual assault of a male child.  


KEVIN COAN, Republican election board official, was sentenced to two years probation for soliciting sex over the Internet (A favorite tool of neo-con pedophiles) from a 14-year old girl. The 'girl' was actually a male Alton police officer who had set up a chat-room sting.


ROY COHN, continually condemned gays and gay rights, but was a closet gay who died of AIDS. He played a prominent role in the trial of eleven leaders of the American Communist Party and in the prosecution of Julius Rosenberg and in 1951. It's obvious that Americans were given a Cohn job by this man.  


REP. DAN CRANE had sex with a female minor working as a congressional page. Rep. Henry Hyde pleaded mercy for his friend before members of the House. 'I suggest to the members that compassion and justice are not antithetical; they are complementary.' They must have been moved by Hyde's compassionate oratory, because they voted to censure Crane rather than expel him. One would never know this was the same Henry Hyde who screamed for blood at the Clinton impeachment hearings, and later admitted this was payback for Nixon.


PAUL CROUCH, Televangelist and former President of Trinity Broadcasting Network, had an extramarital gay affair with a former employee at a network-owned cabin at Lake Arrowhead in 1996. TBN paid $425,000 in hush money to Enoch Lonnie Ford in an attempt squelch the story. However, the LA Times got wind of it and the story got out. Beware LA Times! According to Crouch, God, we proclaim death to anything or anyone that will lift a hand against this network and this ministry that belongs to you, God. However, God does provide for hypocrite neo-cons. It is said that Crouch and his wife own thirty homes across America, as well as a Gulfstream private jet.


RICHARD A. DASEN SR., Republican benefactor of conservative Christian groups, was charged with rape of a 15-year old girl and two felony counts of promoting prostitution, after being caught in a cheap motel, clad in his underwear, with a nearly-naked young lady who was behind in her payments to his finance company. Dasen, 62, is married with grown children and several grandchildren. According to court documents, he admitted to police that he paid more than $1 million to have sex with a large number of young women, many of whom were in legal trouble, addicted to drugs and in debt to him. City Attorney Charles Harball claimed that Dasen pretty much single-handedly funded the methamphetamine trade here in Kalispell for a number of years. He explained that women used the money Dasen paid them to pay for their habits. Harball went on to say that after Dasen's arrest, money to methamphetamine users pretty much dried up. He added that there has been a flood of petty crime from addicts seeking cash for their habit. One might surmise that when it comes to women druggies, Dasen is a compassionate conservative.


RICHARD A. DELGAUDIO, a major GOP fundraiser who collected money for Ronald Reagan and Jessie Helms, was found guilty of producing child pornography, after paying two teenage girls to pose for sexual photos in a Baltimore Hotel.


PETER DIBBLE, legislator from New London, CT, pleaded no contest to having an inappropriate relationship with a 13-year-old girl over a three year period. Obviously Dibble liked to dabble with young girls.


CHARLES K. DUTCHER, associate director of presidential personnel in the Reagan Administration, was part of a major White House scandal during the 1980's. Children from orphanages in Nebraska were transported around the United States by top Republican officials in order to engage in child sex orgies with America's ruling elite. Dutcher paid for homosexual prostitute services which were charged to his credit card. See Paul Robert Balach, Lawrence E. King Jr. & Craig J. Spence.

In the communication, Foley writes: 'it sounds like you will have some fun over the next few weeks...how old are you now?' and 'how are you weathering the hurricane...are you safe...send me an email pic of you as well.' Of course, Foley claims his words were completely taken out of context. Uh-huh!


JOHN FUND of the Wall Street Journal, was a prominent anti-abortion columnist and GOP fund raiser. He lost his position after it was revealed that he impregnated the daughter of an old girlfriend and then encouraged her to abort his child. It's obvious that Fund's biggest Fundraiser was pedophilia.


JEFF GANNON, real name James Guckert, was partisan blogger and regular contributor to GOPUSA.com, with no journalism credentials. Using an alias, he got invited to Bush's Press conferences. Although he has made anti-gay statements, he is a pimp and a gay prostitute. Guckert once advertised himself on the Internet as a 'top' who is '8 inches, cut.' Astonishingly, Guckert had access to Bush that many legitimate journalists were unable to obtain. Hmmm!


RICHARD GARDNER, a Republican candidate for Nevada Assembly District 34, admitted to molesting his two daughters.  


JACK W. GARDNER, is presently a Millersville Boro (PA) councilman, despite having previously been convicted of molesting a 13 year-old girl. The deed took place at the Old Mill Inn in Lancaster County.  


NEWT GINGRICH, former House Speaker, who has hinted he might be a presidential candidate in 2008, was married three times. Gingrich campaign worker Anne Manning admitted that she gave Newt oral sex while he was still married to his first wife. Proving he is a Compassionate Conservative, Newt informed his 1st wife he was filing for divorce while she was in the hospital recovering from cancer treatments. Gingrich was also reprimanded and fined $300,000 by the House Ethics Committee. It seems he had used tax-exempt foundation money to promote Republican goals. He was also found to have lied to the committee during the investigation.


PHILIP GIORDANO, former Mayor of Waterbury, CT, is serving a 37-year sentence in federal prison for sexually abusing 8- and 10-year old girls. This case is the worst I have ever seen,' said U.S. District Judge Alan Nevas in passing sentence. 'Your conduct is the worst I have ever seen. I've seen drug dealers, murderers. What you did is indescribable.'


RUDY GIULIANI, former NYC mayor, is considered a GOP front-runner for 2008 presidential candidacy. He not only committed adultery, but moved his mistress into the Gracie mansion while still married. In February 2005, Giuliani pocketed $80,000 for speaking at a charity benefit for tsunami aid which raised only $60,000 for the victims themselves.


MATTHEW GLAVIN, former president and CEO of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, played a major role in the Clinton Impeachment, pointing the finger at President Clinton on morality issues, and was largely responsible for efforts to get Clinton disbarred in Arkansas. Married with children, Glavin was active many anti-gay causes. However, like other GOP anti-gay self-haters, such viciousness is the result of being buried deep in the closet. Glavin has had multiple arrests for public indecency. One such arrest in October 2000 was in a Chattahoochee River park in Atlanta, a popular spot for same-sex cruising, where Glavin was caught masturbating in a parking lot. The arresting officer claims that he was fondled lewdly by Glavin. Glavin plead guilty and was sentenced to one year probation.

JOHN GOSEK, while serving as Mayor of Oswego, NY, was arrested outside a motel near Syracuse, after offering a $250 payment to a woman in exchange for sex with two teenage girls. Unfortunately for Gosek, this was a sting operation and he got busted. Gosek is facing federal criminal charges of using a facility in interstate commerce (a telephone) to knowingly attempt to persuade, induce, entice, and coerce an individual under the age of 18 years to engage in sexual activity, more commonly referred to as the Mann Act.


MARK A. GRETHEN was to be honored in Washington D.C. as Republican of the Year, an honor bestowed upon him by Representative Tom Davis of Virginia. The problem was that Grethen couldn't make it to the awards ceremony since he was convicted of six counts of sex crimes involving children. He will be in the Deep Meadow Correctional Facility until September 25, 2024.


DR. W. DAVID HAGER, OBGYN, was an avowed anti-abortionist, yet Bush appointed him to the FDA committee on reproductive drugs. He was a member of Focus on the Family's Physician Resource Council and involved in a movement to ban the morning-after-pill. It was revealed that Dr. Hager had an adulterous affair, before divorcing his wife. It was also reported that he sexually abused her, including sodomization while she was asleep. The perfect Bush appointee!


REVERAND TED HAGGARD, right-wing president of the National Association of Evangelicals, ranked by Time Magazine as on of the 25 most influential evangelicals, and staunch supporter of the Gay Marriage Amendment, was accused of having had a three-year relationship with a male prostitute. Haggard once said that homosexuality is a 'sin' and 'devastating for the children of our nation and for the future of Western civilization.' .


MARK HARRIS, a West Bend, WI Alderman, was described as a 'good military man' and 'churchgoer'. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison for repeated sexual assault of a young girl. The molestation began when she was 11 years old, and continued over a two year period.

HOWARD SCOTT HELDRETH, an anti-abortion activist, gained fame when he was arrested for attempting to cross police lines to take water to Terri Shiavo. According to the right-to-lifers, he is a real hero for the un-born. However, Heldreth doesn't fare so well for the living; He is a convicted child rapist in Florida.


REP. JOHN HINSON (Miss), married and ultra-conservative, admitted to being accused of  committing an obscene act at a gay establishment. Furthermore, he acknowledged that he survived a fire in a gay D.C. movie theater, but still denied being homosexual. Hinson won re-election, but three months later was arrested on charges of attempted oral sodomy.


MIKE HINTZ, First Assembly of God youth pastor, was commended by Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign. The pastor was a real champion for decency. He signed an ad that called for criminally prosecuting businesses that sell porn. Among his other achievements, Hintz urged teens to avoid pursuing romantic relationships in favor of getting closer to God. Perhaps Hintz was really prompting teens to get closer to him. Hintz surrendered to police after admitting to a sexual affair with a female juvenile whom (you guessed it) he'd been counseling for emotional problems.


NEAL HORSLEY (pay attention to the last name) is best known among the pro-lifer's for his Nuremberg Files. It lists abortion doctors marked for death. He has called for the arrest of all homosexuals. Horsley admitted on Fox News Radio's The Alan Colmes Show, that he's had sex with mules. This brings a whole new meaning to the phrase Piece of Ass. Horsley also put graphic photographs on his web site of naked men committing homosexual acts and a nude woman engaging in bestiality amid shots of grotesquely maimed fetuses. Horsely openly calls for the establishment of a new government, one that can obey God's plan for government. And what is Horsley's Faustian vision of this plan?

God only knows!


PAUL INGRAM a former top civil sheriff's deputy and head of the Thurston County (WA) Republican Party, pleaded guilty to six counts of raping his daughters. However, so-called victims of 'recovered memory' came to Ingram's rescue, creating a defense fund and trying to generate support for his cause. They suggested that the girls' memories of abuse were manufactured (by Democrats?). Wonderful family values; these wicked children invented the abuse. However, Supreme Court and U.S. District Court upheld the validity of Ingram's plea. Ingram was sentenced to 20 years, but served 14 years in State prison. Even so, many of his cronies believe he is an innocent man who was framed by the devil.


EARL 'BUTCH' KIMMERLING was a moral majority advocate. He gained statewide attention in Indiana by fighting a gay couple's attempts to adopt an 8-year-old girl, who at the time was under Earl's foster care. The Kimmerlings and their pastor, Brad Brizendine of Center of Faith Church, launched a campaign opposing homosexual adoption. Republican representatives also took up the issue by proposing a bill to ban gay adoptions in Indiana. More than likely, the real reason Kimmerling waged his custodial campaign was that he wanted the girl all to himself. He was charged with molesting her and was sentenced to 40 years in prison.


LAWRENCE E. KING JR., a Republican activist, embezzled funds from the credit union which he managed. The money was said to have been funneled to help organize child sex parties at the White House during the 1980's See Paul Robert Balach, Charles K. Dutcher & Craig J. Spence.


I. LEWIS 'SCOOTER' LIBBY is the former Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff to V.P. Dick Cheney. He was forced to resign after being given a 5 felony-count indictment by a grand jury in connection with the 'outing' of Valerie Plame. After being convicted, Libby was pardoned by Bush.

Scooter was also a founding member of Project for the New American Century, a  neo-conservative think tank which created the policy document Rebuilding America's Defences , a draconian manifesto for world domination (to which the Bush Administration has adhered). If you find this unsettling, there's an even more sinister side to Libby. In 1996 he wrote The Apprentice, a novel containing explicit and bizaree sexual content, including beastiality and pedophillia.


REP. BILL LIVINGSTON, (former) House Speaker, continued to call for the resignation of President Bill Clinton during his impeachment hearings, even though Livingston had several days earlier admitted to marital infidelities of his own. Obviously, Livingston was another member of the Do-as-I-say-not-as-I do GOP club. Finally, after receiving 'boo’s' and shouted calls of 'You resign yourself', Livingston was forced to resign.


REP. DONALD 'BUZ' LUKENS (OH) paid a female minor for sex over a four year period, beginning when she was 13 years old. He was secretly videotaped by an Ohio TV station, offering the girl's unemployed mother a government job in exchange for her silence. Lukens was found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and sentenced to one month in jail. However, after serving his sentence, Lukens still refused to resign. He was later accused of fondling a Capitol elevator operator, before finally submitting his resignation.


JON MATTHEWS, a neo-conservative talk show host, was sentenced to seven years' probation for exposing his genitals to an 11-year-old girl. On his show he often voiced the view that those who crossed the law deserved little mercy and harsh punishment. Well, he seems to have received an abundance of mercy and zero harsh punishmentfrom the Liberal court...but he probably didn't complain.


JEFF MILLER, Senate Republican Caucus Chairman in Tennessee and the sponsor of Tennessee's Marriage Protection act, was sued for divorce because of an alleged affair he was having with an office aid. The Marriage Protection Act proclaimed that marriage should be defined as between a one man and one woman. It also banned gay marriage in the state constitution. However, Miller opposed an amendment that would have included an adultery clause.  Now why would he do that?


NICHOLAS MORENCY, an anti-abortion activist, pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography on his computer. He was also found guilty of offering a reward to anybody who murders an abortion doctor.


GLENN MURPHY, Clark County GOP Chair and newly elected Young Republican National Federation Chairperson, is under investigation for criminal deviate conduct. He has been charged with engaging in oral sex with a sleeping victim. The incident allegedly occurred after the two attended a Young Republican party, at the Jefferson, Indiana home of Murphy’s sister. Since both had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol, she had suggested they both spend the night. Murphy alleges that the act was consensual; however the victim claims otherwise. This is not be the first sexual misconduct charge filed against Murphy.


Murphy joins an elite list of outstanding Young Republicans, including TED BUNDY.

BRENT PARKER, a Utah state representative, was arrested for soliciting sex from an undercover officer posing as a male prostitute.


JEFFREY PATTI, Republican Committee Chairman, was arrested for distributing a video clip of a 5-year-old girl being raped.


JOHN PAULK, Christian Fundamentalist and professed ex-gay, lied about prowling for gay sex while running a fundamentalist group to cure gays. Denial is not a river in Egypt.


JUDGE MARK PAZUHANICH molested a ten year-old girl during a Hilary Duff concert. He pleaded no contest to charges of corrupting a minor, endangering the welfare of a child, two counts of indecent assault, and an additional charge of public drunkenness. Pazuhanich was sentenced to 10 years probation.


GEORGE ROCHE III, while serving as president of Conservative Hillsdale College, carried on a torrid 19 year affair with his daughter-in-law, Lissa Roche, who was managing editor of the Hillsdale College Press. The sordid entanglement (which is still denied by many conservatives) apparently led to Roche's divorce from his wife of 44 years. It also must have contributed to Lissa's tragic suicide, just hours after she publicly revealed the details of the affair. Hillsdale College, emphasizes the importance of the common moral truths that bind all Americans, while recognizing the importance of religion for the maintenance of a free society.


BEVERLY RUSSELL, Republican activist and Christian Coalition leader, admitted to an incestuous relationship with his stepdaughter, Susan Smith, whose name was later prominent in the newspaper headlines for having drowning her two children.


JACK RYAN, was the 2004 Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate (IL). However, he had the misfortune of running against popular Democrat Barack Obama. It was alleged by his wife, actress Jeri Ryan, that he pressured her to have sex with other men. According to Jeri, he tricked her into visiting sex clubs, where he asked her to have sex with him while others watched. Ryan called this a smear campaign, even though he consistently trailed Obama in the polls throughout the race.


JOE SCARBOROUGH, Conservative talk show host and pundit, is a former Congressman who was once considered a 'rising star' in the GOP. Suddenly, with no forewarning, he prematurely and unexpectedly resigned his congressional seat to spend more time with his sons. This occurred amidst allegations of an affair, after the congressman had divorced his wife. A short time later, Constituent Services Coordinator Lori Klausutis, was found dead in Scarborough's office of an apparent head injury. Within three hours of the body's discovery, both Rep. Scarborough and his spokesman appeared on two local TV stations, inventing a nonexistent history of chronic medical conditions. Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Berkland ruled the case an accident, after giving conflicting information about Ms. Klausutis' injuries. Berkland admitted he lied because 'The last thing we wanted was 40 questions about a head injury.' The good doctor previously had his license revoked in Missouri for falsifying information in an autopsy report and was suspended in Florida for six years.


DR. LAURA SCHLESSINGER, the right wing radio host family values queen, hasn't spoken to her mother in 15 years and is estranged from her sister. She espouses moral decency, even though she once posed for nude photos which are available online. She openly opposes adultery, and claims: 'Holy sex is between husband and wife. . . .Unholy sex is everything else', yet admits to having had sex before she was married, committing adultery while she was married, and moved in with a married man.


LARRY JACK SCHWARZ, parole board chairman and former Colorado state representative, was fired after child pornography was found in his possession. The pictures and material all involved family members. Schwarz is a father of five and has 16 grandchildren. During his first term, he listed 'crime prevention and punishment' among his key issues.


GOV. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (CA) admittedly participated in group sex and boasted of his penis size in an article in Oui Magazine. He allegedly had sex with a 16 year old girl when he was 28. 
Sixteen women have come forward to say he sexually mistreated and humiliated them.


REP. JOHN SCHMITZ (CA), a former John Bircher, was considered one of the most ultra rightwing members of Congress. Schmitz once referred to Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan as Liberals and idolized Senator Joseph McCarthy. He was known for his outrageous attacks against gays, feminists and Jews. Well, wouldn't you know it, he was forced out of office in 1982 for having an adulterous affair and fathering two children out of wedlock with one of his students. Like father, like daughter; Schmitz gained further notoriety as the father of pedophile Mary Kay LeTourneau, who was convicted of having an adulterous affair with one of her students, a boy of Samoan extraction. Schmitz, of course, tried to get his daughter off the hook by attempting to find a loophole in United States treaties with Samoa.


REP. DON SHERWOOD(PA) eventually admitted to an adultureous affair with a woman 30 years younger than him, after she accused him of physical abuse. Regardless, Sherwood was actively supported by family values neo-conservatives, such as Senator Rick Santorum.


TOM SHORTRIDGE, campaign consultant and former head of the South Bay Republican Club (Redondo Beach CA), was sentenced to three years probation for taking nude photographs of two teenage girls, 15 and 16 years of age, and both employees of his. His attorney claimed that Shortridge was approached by the girls, wanting their nude pictures taken. Yeah, right! Take a look at the photo of this behemoth and you decide! According to prosecutors, the reduced sentence for this horny toad was more than fair; it could have been a lot stiffer.


FRED C. SMELTZER, JR., City Councilman (Lancaster, PA), pleaded no contest to raping a 15 year-old girl at a Delaware campground, and served 6 months in prison. In a court affidavit, an acquaintance of Smeltzer's claimed that he had raped his daughter at this campground. Due to laws which shield children's identities in matters such as these, it was not revealed (but evident) that she was the actual victim of this crime. Smeltzer is now a registered sex offender.


CRAIG J. SPENCE, Republican lobbyist, was part of a major White House scandal during the 1980's. Children from orphanages in Nebraska were transported around the United States by top Republican officials in order to engage in child sex orgies with America's ruling elite. Spence took friends and male prostitutes on late-night sexcursions to the White House. Spence also faced cocaine and gun possession charges. Unfortunately, this Republican really fell on his sword. He was found dead in a Boston hotel room. See, Paul Robert Balach, Charles K. Dutcher & Lawrence E. King, Jr..


JIMMY SWAGGART, is the televangelist who once said: 'You boys and girls that have Beatle records at home, this is the most rotten, dirty, damnable, filthy, putrid filth that this nation or the world has ever known.' Wouldn't you know it, Swaggart was caught in a seedy motel with a prostitute, being dirty, damnable and filthy. Ah, but God favors Republicans. Swaggart repented and was saved. President Bill Clinton also repented, but evidently he can never be forgiven and will rot in hell for his sins.


DAVID SWARTZ, Commissioner (Richmond County, OH), pleaded guilty to molesting two girls, which began at ages 6-7. Swartz admitted in court to having sex with the first girl. It was learned that the molestation took place for a decade. The 2nd occurred over a period of 5 years. He was sentenced to 8 years in prison.


RANDALL TERRY, Right to Life activist and founder of Operation Rescue, gained much of his notoriety in the Terri Schiavo protests. He was once imprisoned for sending former President Bill Clinton an aborted fetus. There is strong evidence Operation Rescue may have been responsible for the violence against abortion clinics. One of Terry's fervent followers was charged with 2nd Degree murder of a doctor who performed abortions. As with most hypocrites, Terry's personal life is filled with contradictions. He has campaigned against infidelity, yet he was censured by his church, for a 'pattern of repeated and sinful relationships and conversations with both single and married women.' He has spoken out against unwed mothers, yet his daughter had 2 children outside wedlock. He has denounced homosexuals, yet his son is gay. True to his convictions, however, he has all but disowned both children. On his website, Terry appealed to his flock for donations to support Operation Rescue's pro-life activities, but failed  to disclose that the money would be used to purchase a new $432,000 house. At the same time a family court ruled that Terry, 'was not paying a fair share of child support' regarding the children of his first wife.


REP. BILL THOMAS (CA) (See page 13 of this link), former chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee and cosponsor of the industry-sponsored Medicare reform legislation, had an adulterous affair with Deborah Steelman, a health care lobbyist. who bestowed humongous gifts to Thomas' war chest. You see Ms. Steelman had the most to gain from this union. Her Washington firm received $2.4 million in lobbying fees from health interests, including $900,000 from pharmaceutical manufacturers.


SEN. STROM THURMOND, the rightwing family values standard-bearer whose racist history is well-documented, had sex with a 15-year old black girl which produced a child.


RANDALL L. TOBIAS, (former) Deputy Secretary of State, on April 27, 2007, suddenly resigned from the State Department, after it was revealed his telephone number was included in the phone records of Pamela Martin and Associates, a.k.a., the D.C. Madam. Tobias claimed he only used the Madam’s services for the purposes of massage.


ROBIN VANDERWALL was a GOP strategist, Citadel Military College graduate, and 3rd year law student at Pat Robertson's Regent University. He was also director of Faith & Family Alliance. Vanderwall helped funnel money from Jack Abromoff to Ralph Reed. In 2002, he was convicted in Virginia on five counts of soliciting sex with (what he thought were) children over the Internet. Like Brian J. Doyle, Vanderwall had played into a police sting operation. The Internet seems to be a favorite tool of GOP pedophiles.


SENATOR DAVID VITTER (R-La) following in the footsteps of fellow LA GOP hypocrite, (former) House Speaker Rep. Bill Livingston (Listed above), once campaigned with the promise of 'protecting the sanctity of marriage', and was the co-author of the 'Federal Marriage Act'. On Vitter’s website, he purports to be an active lector at his church and is dedicated to 'advancing mainstream conservative principles.'


On July 9, 2007, Senator Vitter apologized for the revelation that his telephone number was included in the phone records of Pamela Martin and Associates, a.k.a., the D.C. Madam. Of course, Senator Vitter claimed he had received forgiveness from God (not an option given to Democrats) and his wife. According to the a Times-Picayune article, Sen. Vitter visited a Canal Street brothel on more than one occasion beginning in the mid-1990’s, forking over $300 per hour for services rendered.

Interestingly, Wendy Vitter was once asked how she would react if her husband was caught in affair like those of Bill Clinton and Bill Livingston. At the time she claimed:

'I'm a lot more like Lorena Bobbitt than Hillary [Clinton],' she said. 'If he does something like that, I'm walking away with one thing, and it's not alimony, trust me.'

.


During Vitter’s press conference, know one asked the obvious question; does he still have them? 


JIM WEST, Mayor (Spokane, WA), supported a bill which, if it hadn't failed, would have barred gays and lesbians from working in schools, day-care centers and some state agencies. He also voted to bar the state from distributing pamphlets telling people how to protect themselves from AIDS. To prove his worthiness with other family values Republicans, he proposed legislation that would criminalize 'any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person' among unmarried teenagers. As it turns out, the reason West was so vicious was that he was deep in the closet: West had a sexual affair with an 18 year old boy, and he propositioned what he thought was a high school senior over the Internet, offering an internship at City Hall for services rendered. The boy, we learn, was actually a computer consultant, hired by a newspaper to verify the mayor's identity and presence on Gay.com. In other words, Jim was caught with his virtual pants down.


REP. KEITH WESTMORELAND (FL) was charged with seven felony counts of lewd and lascivious exhibition to girls under the age of 16. Shortly thereafter, he committed suicide. Ironically, Rep. Westmoreland had a bachelor's degree in criminal justice.


STEPHEN WHITE, better known to Penn students as Brother Stephen, was vocal in his condemnation of gays and sexual promiscuity in his campus preaching. He was also known for his abrasive methods and harassment of students as they passed him on campus. You can add Brother Stephen to the list of vicious GOP closet queens. He was sentenced to jail after soliciting a 14-year-old boy, offering $20 to perform oral sex on him.">
