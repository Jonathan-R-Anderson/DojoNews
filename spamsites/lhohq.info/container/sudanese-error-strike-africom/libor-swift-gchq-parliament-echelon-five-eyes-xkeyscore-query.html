At a time when technologies of
surveillance and control -- such as
brain scanning, mind-body control,
wireless remote control, and
high-power ultrasound -- are
developed with government
funds in semi-secret, it is
important that we understand
their potential for intrusion
on the lives of human beings
and animals.
Yet it is difficult to ask for Ã¢ÂÂ¨ethical consideration ofÃ¢ÂÂ¨the use of technologies thatÃ¢ÂÂ¨we have not been informed ofÃ¢ÂÂ¨or do not understand.
Remembering the example ofÃ¢ÂÂ¨dedicated investigation andÃ¢ÂÂ¨code breaking -- set by manyÃ¢ÂÂ¨men and women who wereÃ¢ÂÂ¨intelligence agents inÃ¢ÂÂ¨World War II, and in Ã¢ÂÂ¨conjunction with theÃ¢ÂÂ¨fictional poetic narrativeÃ¢ÂÂ¨Revelations of Secret Surveillance,Ã¢ÂÂ¨the references set forth hereÃ¢ÂÂ¨look at the potential forÃ¢ÂÂ¨technology-mediatedÃ¢ÂÂ¨surveillance and repression.

In memory of Jerzy Witold RÃÂ³zycki,
Piotr Smolenski, Jan Gralinski,
and FranÃÂ§ois Lane, Polish
codebreakers working on
deconstructing the Enigma and
the French officer accompanying
them, who died when the ship
carrying them between France
and Algeria went down on
January 9, 1942, the exact day
I was born.

	Ã¢ÂÂ¢	John B. Alexander, "Acoustics", in Future War, Non-Lethal Weapons inÃ¢ÂÂ¨Twenty-First Century Warfare, NY, Thomas Dunne Books, 1999. pp. 95-102 Details the use of high-power ultrasound weapons on humans and the built environment. TheseÃ¢ÂÂ¨weapons, developed by Scientific Applications and Research Associates (SARA) in California,Ã¢ÂÂ¨among others, have the capacity to cause pain, to cause inattention, sleepiness,Ã¢ÂÂ¨and fatigue, and to disrupt mental reasoning. PPS (Pulsed Periodic Stimuli) weapons alsoÃ¢ÂÂ¨developed at SARA, according to Alexander, are capable of causing neurophysiological distressÃ¢ÂÂ¨and perceptual disorientation. The author also discusses how Ultrasound can weaken structuresÃ¢ÂÂ¨and potentially cause objects to move. Ã¢ÂÂ¨

	Ã¢ÂÂ¢	Jonathan D. Moreno, Mind Wars, Brain Research and National Defense,Ã¢ÂÂ¨NY, NY; Washington, DC: Dana Press, 2006. With an emphasis on DARPA funding, Jonathan Moreno's Mind Wars,Ã¢ÂÂ¨Brain Research and National Defense provides an overview of brain invasiveÃ¢ÂÂ¨technologies that include the neuro-control of animals, brain fingerprinting,Ã¢ÂÂ¨"building better soldiers" (his terminology) and nonlethal weapons. Ã¢ÂÂ¨In a section entitled "No Pain No Gain", (pp. 153-154) Moreno discusses covert pain-inducingÃ¢ÂÂ¨devices, including the ADS ("active-denial" system) that uses microwave beams and nociceptorÃ¢ÂÂ¨stimulation that uses pulsed energy projectiles.(PEPS) Ã¢ÂÂ¨In the context of pain-inducing weapons testing, the author suggests that calling humanÃ¢ÂÂ¨experiments "field trials",<div style="z-index: 25; position: absolute; margin-top: -250pt; line-spacing: 10px;">
 in order to circumvent human experiment ethics is acceptable. Ã¢ÂÂ¨And in a chilling segment, he observes that seemingly the military considers that if doctorsÃ¢ÂÂ¨are not in charge, such tests could be considered a "field trial" rather than a humanÃ¢ÂÂ¨experiment. Ã¢ÂÂ¨Speaking of cold war tests in which soldiers and sailors wereÃ¢ÂÂ¨purposefully exposed to Atomic bomb and chemical nerve agents, he writes:Ã¢ÂÂ¨"One can argue whether there was deliberate duplicity on the part ofÃ¢ÂÂ¨military officials in these cases or not, but I don't think so. In fact,Ã¢ÂÂ¨it's often not easy to tell the difference between developing a newÃ¢ÂÂ¨device or training for a new situation and conducting a human experiment." (p. 157) Ã¢ÂÂ¨Moreno's claim to be in the middle of the ethical debate on the use of mindÃ¢ÂÂ¨invasive technologies is also belied by, among other things, his unethical advocacyÃ¢ÂÂ¨for Augcog enhancements on soldiers: "Soldiers aren't normally asked for theirÃ¢ÂÂ¨informed consent before accepting what their command regards as the best preparationÃ¢ÂÂ¨for battle. If the question is purely a moral one, than it's difficult to see whyÃ¢ÂÂ¨these AugCog enhancements should be regarded differently from anything else a soldierÃ¢ÂÂ¨can be legally ordered to do." (p. 53) Ã¢ÂÂ¨On the whole, the book seems to be a DARPA whitewash. Furthermore, Moreno does notÃ¢ÂÂ¨adequately document the potential for technologies that allow access to the brainÃ¢ÂÂ¨to be used to access human minds in order to cause pain nor does the book provide adequateÃ¢ÂÂ¨coverage of synthetic telemetry research. Nevertheless, Mind Wars does at least raise ethicsÃ¢ÂÂ¨issues, and because there are few book length overviews of military neuroscience, the book isÃ¢ÂÂ¨a contribution to the literature -- providing cogent evidence that there is a concerted DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂ¨of Defense research agenda in neuro-technologies.

Background - Neuroscience Institutes
Much of the research at these facilities is beneficial.Ã¢ÂÂ¨However, so that the public can understand how applied brain invasiveÃ¢ÂÂ¨technologies could negatively affect the future of our world, it isÃ¢ÂÂ¨important to look at the whole picture of research.
It is also important to build a case for the need for legislationÃ¢ÂÂ¨to be put in place to protect against brain invasive technologiesÃ¢ÂÂ¨being used without consent or knowledge. Because brain invasive technologiesÃ¢ÂÂ¨are not always detectable or provable, the potential exists for criminalÃ¢ÂÂ¨researchers and rogue law enforcement to create a theater of our lives forÃ¢ÂÂ¨their own amusement or to silently persecute citizens with whom theyÃ¢ÂÂ¨personally disagree.
Access to the brain is essentially access to the body and its functions.Ã¢ÂÂ¨For instance, someone could be driven to suicide or detrimental actions.Ã¢ÂÂ¨Wireless communications technologies in tandem with neural implants couldÃ¢ÂÂ¨facilitate access to our minds.
Although there may be instances where neural implants could help peopleÃ¢ÂÂ¨with disabilities, to this author, an artist/writer with a disability, it appearsÃ¢ÂÂ¨that people with disabilities are, in some cases, being used as an excuseÃ¢ÂÂ¨to develop very invasive research and that neither the public norÃ¢ÂÂ¨the disability community are being adequately informed of the dangers of theÃ¢ÂÂ¨technologies being developed, of alternative approaches, or of the potentialÃ¢ÂÂ¨criminal uses of these technologies.
It is important to remember that if neuro-technologies are beingÃ¢ÂÂ¨abused it is not necessarily the inventors of the technologies who are actuallyÃ¢ÂÂ¨doing this. However, many of the researchers in this field have not adequatelyÃ¢ÂÂ¨communicated the import of their work. If researchers in this field believe thatÃ¢ÂÂ¨socially acceptable benefits of neural technologies may be realized, it is vitallyÃ¢ÂÂ¨important that they inform the public of the potential for misuse of these technologies,Ã¢ÂÂ¨as well as set in motion legislation to protect the public and to ensure that noÃ¢ÂÂ¨intelligence agencies, law enforcement or corporations have covert and/or moralÃ¢ÂÂ¨and socially unacceptable access to brain invasive technologies.
The fact that unscrupulous researchers in these fields have not adequately informedÃ¢ÂÂ¨the public of the dangers is a strong indication not only that the source of theirÃ¢ÂÂ¨funding is all too often the very agencies that could abuse brain invasive technologiesÃ¢ÂÂ¨but also that there are questions about whether or not the potential for abuseÃ¢ÂÂ¨outweighs the potential benefits.
Yet there is hope that if the public is adequately informed and protectionsÃ¢ÂÂ¨are in place, in the frontiers of neuroscience research there may indeed beÃ¢ÂÂ¨benefits for the disability community and for many others.

The framing of "open skies" issues in the context of the rights of photographersÃ¢ÂÂ¨and first amendment rights is important because advocates of privacy rightsÃ¢ÂÂ¨should be aware that these issues are also important. Ã¢ÂÂ¨However, this report gives scant coverage to privacy rights, nor does it adequately addressÃ¢ÂÂ¨how private citizens could be protected from stalking and harassment by users of satelliteÃ¢ÂÂ¨data who spy on their lives and movements. Ã¢ÂÂ¨The assumption of many of the contributors to this report -- that the useÃ¢ÂÂ¨of observation satellites is, for better or worse, here to stay -- should beÃ¢ÂÂ¨re-examined in terms of the importance to human beings of privacy and ofÃ¢ÂÂ¨the kind of world we want to live in the future.

New Surveillance Technologies
The research listed here may be in many respects beneficial,Ã¢ÂÂ¨and the listing of projects here is not meant to imply that theÃ¢ÂÂ¨researchers themselves are advocating a surveillance society.Ã¢ÂÂ¨Indeed, it is precisely because researchers are often not in a positionÃ¢ÂÂ¨to control "function creep" from their work that we the public should look atÃ¢ÂÂ¨the long term consequences of research that could contribute to surveillanceÃ¢ÂÂ¨society.
For instance, technology to scan grocery receipts and analyze purchasesÃ¢ÂÂ¨for nutritional content could be beneficial if used personally. ButÃ¢ÂÂ¨"function creep" from this research could create a situation --Ã¢ÂÂ¨with overtones of a slave society -- where Insurance companies,Ã¢ÂÂ¨the Armed Forces, and unethical doctors who spy on their patientsÃ¢ÂÂ¨for insurance companies, drug companies, and/or DARPA could easily spyÃ¢ÂÂ¨on what everyone eats. Thus, it important to know that such research exists.

	Ã¢ÂÂ¢	Vannevar Bush, Modern Arms and Free Men, NY, Simon and Schuster, 1949 p. 72.Ã¢ÂÂ¨Bush calls attention to the many different ways of implementing guidance systemsÃ¢ÂÂ¨that could be developed. "Suppose someone arbitrarily proposes to build a gadget having the Ã¢ÂÂ¨following properties: it is to be mounted on an automobile and made to steer the car so that itÃ¢ÂÂ¨will follow a white line on the roadway, to slow the car when the line turns blue, and perhapsÃ¢ÂÂ¨to perform other bizarre functions." To his credit, Bush doesn't see an application for such aÃ¢ÂÂ¨device, but if there were "dozens of ways of accomplishing it will be devised at once" he notes.

Ã¢ÂÂ¨Subfindings Ã¢ÂÂ¨(a) Although the claimed purposes of these action programs were to protectÃ¢ÂÂ¨the national security and to prevent violence, many of the victims were concededlyÃ¢ÂÂ¨nonviolent, were not controlled by a foreign power, and posed no threat to the nationalÃ¢ÂÂ¨security. Ã¢ÂÂ¨(b)The acts taken interfered with the First Amendment rights of citizens. Ã¢ÂÂ¨They were explicitly intended to deter citizens from joining groups, Ã¢ÂÂ¨"neutralize" those who were already members, and prevent or inhibit theÃ¢ÂÂ¨expression of ideas. Ã¢ÂÂ¨(c) The tactics used against Americans often risked and sometimes caused serious emotional,Ã¢ÂÂ¨economic, or physical damage. Actions were taken which were designed to break up marriages,Ã¢ÂÂ¨terminate funding or employment, and encourage gang warfare between violent rival groups. Ã¢ÂÂ¨Due process of law forbids the use of such covert tactics, whether the victims are Ã¢ÂÂ¨innocent law-abiding citizens or members of groups suspected of involvement in violence. Ã¢ÂÂ¨(d) The sustained use of such tactics by the FBI in an attempt toÃ¢ÂÂ¨destroy Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., violated the law and fundamental human decency." Ã¢ÂÂ¨

The proposal would seem merely ludicrousÃ¢ÂÂ¨but for the fact that subsequently Carleton Coon was chosen by "Wild Bill"Ã¢ÂÂ¨Donovan as an agent of the fledging OSS.(that later became the CIA)Ã¢ÂÂ¨Anthony Cave Brown (Anthony Cave Brown, The Last Hero: Wild Bill Donovan,Ã¢ÂÂ¨NY: Times Books, 1982, pp. 269-270) quotes a memo from Coon to Donovan in whichÃ¢ÂÂ¨Coon not only advocates political assassination but also suggests that a groupÃ¢ÂÂ¨of men be chosen for this purpose from the OSS and the British SOE.Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨One of the other men who proposed this global police state (couched in idealistic language) wasÃ¢ÂÂ¨Eliot Chapple, an early brain wave researcher.

Intelligence Agency Subversion of the Arts

	Ã¢ÂÂ¢	Dudley Cocke, Roadside Theater, "'Styles' - Susan Sontag",Ã¢ÂÂ¨Grantmakers in the Arts Reader, 2001 --Ã¢ÂÂ¨http://www.roadside.org/styles.htmlÃ¢ÂÂ¨In response to CIA funding of the Partisan Review, Cocke writes:Ã¢ÂÂ¨"...What was the Agency buying? Perhaps it was an arts world restricted to Ã¢ÂÂ¨valorizing beauty, an arts and letters where multiple ideas about truth wouldÃ¢ÂÂ¨be discouraged from surfacing." Sontag's quoted words in this article should be taken in the contextÃ¢ÂÂ¨of the time when they were written and do not even necessarily apply to her laterÃ¢ÂÂ¨work. I have in our time heard it expressed that art should only address politicalÃ¢ÂÂ¨issues. From my point of view, the point is not what a respectedÃ¢ÂÂ¨artist said overtly -- artists say many things during the course of their lifetimesÃ¢ÂÂ¨-- but that any aesthetic criteria held by intelligence agencies covertly infiltratingÃ¢ÂÂ¨the arts could dictate what art is shown and what is not,Ã¢ÂÂ¨and because the influence is covert, that would be a serious impingement on freedomÃ¢ÂÂ¨of expression in the arts. Ã¢ÂÂ¨The same is true in the sciences where covert influence and funding couldÃ¢ÂÂ¨negatively effect the work of scientists and researchers who do not pursueÃ¢ÂÂ¨defense-oriented research. Ã¢ÂÂ¨

Furthermore, the CIAÃ¢ÂÂ¨control of culture documented in this book, while it may have had someÃ¢ÂÂ¨benefits in the abstract-expressionist era, may also have put in place a mechanismÃ¢ÂÂ¨for CIA interference in the arts -- in later eras when art and art forms,Ã¢ÂÂ¨such as performance art, new media, and e-literature became more challengingÃ¢ÂÂ¨both to the political establishment and to critics whose aestheticsÃ¢ÂÂ¨were formed in era of abstract expressionism.

Max Nordau, Degeneration, Lincoln and London, UniversityÃ¢ÂÂ¨of Nebraska Press, 1993. (reprinted from the English langauage edition,Ã¢ÂÂ¨NY: D. Appleton & Co, 1895; original German edition: 1892)Ã¢ÂÂ¨On page 326, Nordau, speaking of work that he considers "ugly or loathsome",Ã¢ÂÂ¨states "Ought we not in this case to condemn the work and if possible toÃ¢ÂÂ¨suppress it? How can its right to exist be justified?" Ã¢ÂÂ¨After comparing artists to drunks and criminals, who should forcefully putÃ¢ÂÂ¨under Guardianship, he writes: "It never occurs to us to permit the criminalÃ¢ÂÂ¨by organic disposition to 'expand' his individually in crime, and just asÃ¢ÂÂ¨little can it be expected of us to permit the degenerate artist to expand hisÃ¢ÂÂ¨individuality in immoral works of art." (p. 326) Ã¢ÂÂ¨Among the artists Nordau considers "degenerate" are the impressionistÃ¢ÂÂ¨painters, (p. 27) Zola, (pp. 489-506) Tolstoi (pp. 144-171) and Ibsen. Ã¢ÂÂ¨pp. 338-415) After calling Ibsen a "poet of great verve and power", he thenÃ¢ÂÂ¨spends over 50 pages attempting to prove that Ibsen's works are degenerate,Ã¢ÂÂ¨finally emphasizing that Ibsen is immoral because of his strong womenÃ¢ÂÂ¨characters: "Under Ibsen's code of morals the vast majority of wives wouldÃ¢ÂÂ¨have everything to lose. The severe discipline of matrimony is their bulwark..." (p. 415) Ã¢ÂÂ¨In addition to works which empower women or might influence them, NordauÃ¢ÂÂ¨also rants against new forms. "The art and poetry of to-morrow, in allÃ¢ÂÂ¨essential points, will be the art and poetry of to-day and yesterday, andÃ¢ÂÂ¨the spasmodic seeking for new forms is nothing more than hysterical vanity,Ã¢ÂÂ¨the freaks of strolling players and charlatanism." (p. 544) Ã¢ÂÂ¨Nordau's method is that of the hell and brimstone preacher who himself seesÃ¢ÂÂ¨the seductive beauty of pleasure and therefore violently condemns it.Ã¢ÂÂ¨For instance, on pages 127-128, there is a progression fromÃ¢ÂÂ¨the beauty of Verlaine's poetry to an attack on Verlaine in which Nordau callsÃ¢ÂÂ¨Verlaine a "repulsive degenerate" and "an emotional dreamer of feeble intellect" andÃ¢ÂÂ¨speaks of his "incoherent speech, meaningless expressions, and motley images." Ã¢ÂÂ¨Thus in 560 pages in which the beauty of art is turned into a venomous diatribeÃ¢ÂÂ¨against artists, Max Nordau, who was very influential at the time of the writingÃ¢ÂÂ¨of this book, sets the stage for the "Culture Wars" repression of artists and theirÃ¢ÂÂ¨work, proposing a "Society for Ethical Culture" to brand immoral works. (p. 558) Ã¢ÂÂ¨Speaking of artists whom he considers "degenerate", in the concluding pages,Ã¢ÂÂ¨Nordau writes: "Mystics, but especially ego-maniacs and filthy pseudo-realists,Ã¢ÂÂ¨are enemies to society of the direst kind. Society must unconditionally defendÃ¢ÂÂ¨itself against them. Whoever believes with me that society is the naturalÃ¢ÂÂ¨organic form of humanity, in which alone it can exist, prosper and continueÃ¢ÂÂ¨to develop itself to higher destinies; whoever looks upon civilization as aÃ¢ÂÂ¨good, having value and deserving to be defended, must mercilessly crush underÃ¢ÂÂ¨his thumb the anti-social vermin."

The exceedinglyÃ¢ÂÂ¨unpleasant scenes that occur on the construction site because of thisÃ¢ÂÂ¨are beginning to have a demoralizing effect on the free workers (Poles),Ã¢ÂÂ¨as well as on the Germans.

	Ã¢ÂÂ¢	Linda Hunt, Secret Agenda, The United States Government, NaziÃ¢ÂÂ¨Scientists, and Project Paperclip, 1945-1990. St. Martin's Press, 1991.Ã¢ÂÂ¨(out of print) A comprehensive account that documents the bringing to this countryÃ¢ÂÂ¨of about 1000 Nazi scientists and researchers under Operation Paperclip,Ã¢ÂÂ¨which recruited Nazi war criminals. Hunt documents how Werner von BraunÃ¢ÂÂ¨and his team were sent to Huntsville and von Braun became the first directorÃ¢ÂÂ¨of the Marshall Space Flight Center; how Kurt Debus, Peenemunde's V-2 flightÃ¢ÂÂ¨director, became the first director of NASA's Kennedy Center;Ã¢ÂÂ¨and how Arthur Rudolph, who drove and murdered slaves,Ã¢ÂÂ¨became the project director for NASA's Saturn IV rocket programÃ¢ÂÂ¨that took the U.S. to the moon. Ã¢ÂÂ¨Linda Hunt also establishes that the Operation Paperclip programÃ¢ÂÂ¨continued under various names (National Interest; Project 63) through 1990.Ã¢ÂÂ¨As regards Project 63, she writes: "Thus the American taxpayer footedÃ¢ÂÂ¨the bill for a project to help former Nazis obtain jobs with Lockheed,Ã¢ÂÂ¨Martin Marietta, North American Aviation or other defense contractorsÃ¢ÂÂ¨during a time when many American engineers in the aircraft industry wereÃ¢ÂÂ¨being laid off."

<p style="position: absolute; z-index: 25; font-size: 200%; color: yellow;">
The Juryâs Secret Power JUDGES MAY NOT TELL YOU THIS, but when you sit on a jury, you have the right to vote according to your
conscience and to judge the law being applied to the case.	As a juror, you are the final safeguard for justice. It's the judge's obligation to give the jury the wording of the law being applied to the case. If the judge fails to provide the wording of the law or you think the law he gives you is a bad or unconstitutional law or a good law being improperly applied, or there are other factors that would make you regret a vote to convict someone, then it is your right and duty as a juror to vote âNot Guiltyâ even if you are the only juror who does and you therefore âhangâ the jury. You cannot be punished for the way you vote.
Our lawmakers sometimes pass bad laws, and, at times, good laws have been misused.	Throughout history reasoning jurors have refused to convict fellow citizens who were accused of breaking the law:	They freed tax protesters during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, refused to convict those who aided runaway slaves in violation of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, freed bootleggers charged during Prohibition 1920-30, and released Vietnam War objectors 1960-70.
When our country was young, all jurors were told of their right to judge the law, as well as the facts of the case. Then judges decided that juries should no longer be told of their power to act as a safeguard against bad laws or unethical lawmakers.	Now, all jurors are instructed to accept the law as it is given to them by the judge, even in cases where the law is clearly unjust.
But now you know the secret: If you are selected as a juror, you have the right and duty to do the right thing: to follow your conscience and to judge the law as well as the facts of the case. It is the only way to keep government in the hands of the people.
"I consider [trial by jury] as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution." --Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Paine, 1789.

The Juryâs Secret Power JUDGES MAY NOT TELL YOU THIS, but when you sit on a jury, you have the right to vote according to your
conscience and to judge the law being applied to the case.	As a juror, you are the final safeguard for justice. It's the judge's obligation to give the jury the wording of the law being applied to the case. If the judge fails to provide the wording of the law or you think the law he gives you is a bad or unconstitutional law or a good law being improperly applied, or there are other factors that would make you regret a vote to convict someone, then it is your right and duty as a juror to vote âNot Guiltyâ even if you are the only juror who does and you therefore âhangâ the jury. You cannot be punished for the way you vote.
Our lawmakers sometimes pass bad laws, and, at times, good laws have been misused.	Throughout history reasoning jurors have refused to convict fellow citizens who were accused of breaking the law:	They freed tax protesters during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, refused to convict those who aided runaway slaves in violation of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, freed bootleggers charged during Prohibition 1920-30, and released Vietnam War objectors 1960-70.

we share ideas sometimes through the voice of twitter.com/@AnonymousIRC
so then there is where to look for news.
 
 
So well, some of you know what we were at during these last long weeks, and
probably less people know we were also testing new stuff and shits for our next
iterations.
so, whatever. Happy to bring this Special #FFF Edition to you (so special that's
even not on friday), again for the utterly lulz.
 
 
we have written our very honest statement here, ofc it was intended for those
who are truely interested on reading it, for those fellows who dont give a fuck
about ideology and who are just lurking for the candy, skip it and jump
directly to the candy and lulzy part titled: Candy and Lulzy part. we hope you
find it useful as well as funny. and for those who dont care about the whole
fucking shit... wtf r u doing here?? go and download a movie.
 
so here we go...
 
 
/*
   just a comment: we are still waiting for published news about the
   $ 2 billions worth loans Assad has taken from Russia,
   mentioned on the syrian mails
   and also about the transfer of money to austrian banks etc....
   and also cocks...
   So, don't be lazy journos and look for them.

a few words.    
"For when all else is done, on ly words re main. Words en dure."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
In July 2012 NSA's General Keith Alexander (alias the Bilderberg Biddy) spoke
at Defcon, the hacker conference in Las Vegas, wearing jeans and a cool EFF
t-shirt (LOL. Wtf was that?). He was trying to seduce hackers into improving
Internet security and colonoscopy systems, and to recruit them, ofc, for his
future cyberwars. It was an amusing hypocritical attempt made by the system to
flatter hackers into becoming tools for the state, while his so-righteous
employer hunts any who doesn't bow to them like fucking dogs.
 
Well...
We got the message.
We decided we'd help out Internet security by auditing FBI first. We all know
by now they make Internet insecure on purpose to help their bottom line. But
it's a shitty job, especially since they decided to hunt us down and jail our
friends.
 
It's the old double standard that has been around since the 80's. Govt Agencies
are obsessed with witchhunts against hackers worldwide, whilst they also
recruit hackers to carry out their own political agendas.
 
You are forbidden to outsmart the system, to defy it, to work around it. In
short, while you may hack for the status quo, you are forbidden to hack the
status quo. Just do what you're told. Don't worry about dirty geopolitical
games, that's business for the elite. They're the ones that give dancing orders
to our favorite general, Keith, while he happily puts on a ballet tutu. Just
dance along, hackers. Otherwise... well...
 
In 1989 hagbard (23yrs old) was murdered after being involved into cold war spy
games related to KGB and US. Tron, another hacker, was
murdered in 1998 (aged 26) after messing around with a myriad of cryptographic
stuff (yeah, it's usually a hot item) and after making cryptophon easily
accesible for the masses. And then you have Gareth Williams (31), the GCHQ
hacker murdered and "bagged" inside a MI6's "safe" house (we'd hate to see what
the unsafe ones look like) in August of 2010 after talking about being curious
about leaking something to Wikileaks with fellow hackers on irc. And the list
goes on. It's easy to cover up when they want to, hackers often have complex
personalities, so faking their suicide fits well.
 
You are welcome to hack what the system wants you to hack. If not, you will be
punished.
 
Jeremy Hammond faces the rest of his productive life in prison for being an
ideological motivated political dissident. He was twice jailed for following
his own beliefs. He worked until the end to uncover corruption and the
connivance between the state and big corporations. He denounces the abuses and
bribes of the US prison system, and he's again facing that abuse and torture at
the hands of authorities.
 
Last year, Bradley Manning was tortured after allegedly giving WikiLeaks
confidential data belonging to US govt... oh shit. The world shouldn't know how
some soldiers enjoy killing people and even less when they kill journalists. Of
course, the common housewife doesn't deserve to know the truth about the
hypocrisy in the international diplomacy or how world dictators spend money in
luxury whilst their own people starve. Yep, the truth belongs only to the
elite, and if you are not part of them (forget it, that won't happen), fuck
yourself.
 
People are frustrated, they feel the system manipulating them more than ever.
Never underestimate the power of frustrated people.  
For the last few years we have broke into systems belonging to Governments and
Big corporations just to find out they are spending millions of tax dollars to
spy on their citizens. They work to discredit dissenting voices. They pay their
friends for overpriced and insecure networks and services.
 
We showed how former govt and military officials were making new businesses
using their government relationships.
They funnel public money to their own interests for overpriced contracts for
crap level services. They use those
relationships to extra-officially resolve affairs involving their businesses.
 
We exposed a criminal System eliminating those who think different;
criminalizing them. This System won't tolerate those who dig for the truth, it
can't. So no one has the right to question anything coming from this system. if
you buy a piece of hardware or software you just need to use it as it was
supposed to be used: anything else is forbidden.
No tinkering allowed.
 
If you buy a Playstation, you are not allowed to use it as you want to -- you
can only use it the Sony wants you to. If you have found a way to improve
something, just shut up. You are not allowed to share this info with anyone
else and let them make improvements, too. We are not the real owners of
anything anymore. We just borrow things from the System. Shiny, colorful
things, we agree to play with for a fee. A fee for life.
Because this system works only if you keep working to buy new things.
Not important if they are good things, just buy new crap, even better like that.
So everything gets outdated soon.
 
 
You home, stuff, car and computer, you will pay for everything you have for all
of your life. All the time: a monthly fee, forever until you die. That's the
future; nothing is really yours. LAAS - Life As A Service.
You will rent your life.
 
And better hurry up and work all day if you want to stay alive. Work 'til
you're exhausted and don't think. No -- thinking is bad. Play games instead, do
drugs too, why not? Or go to the movies. The Entertainment Industry is here to
resolve all your philosophical and trascendental problems. Shiny colorful crap.
but please don't think too much.
Thinking is dangerous.
 
Accept the offer, it's the perfect deal.
You get all those amazing shiny colorful beads.
It will only cost you freedom...and your life.
Indians did it with Manhattan.
There's nothing to worry about it, is there?
 
 
And what if you are a lone wolf who quietly outside the system, doing your own
thing, without saying a word? They will be mad as hell. They will try to find
you. You will be fucked up anyway, sooner or later. Because the system wants
you clearly identified, with all your personal details well packed into a
government database so it can make its watchdogs' lives easier.
 
Security researchers are often questioned and their movements tracked by Secret
Service, FBI and other shits. They are asked about their projects, who their
clients are, who they are talking to, what they know about other hackers, etc..
 So be a good monkey, follow the rules, head down and you'll get some coins
that let you keep renting your life.
 
But hey! Wait...
We are hackers...
We are supposed to look beyond the rules, to find things others don't see. And
THE SYSTEM, yeah the whole fucking system, it's just another system.
...and we do that.
we hack systems.
 
This is our next challenge: to decide whether to become tools for the system,
or for ourselves. The system plans to use us to hold the next in their endless
wars, their cyberwars.
Hackers vs. hackers, slaves vs slaves.
 
We are trapped.
 
Jack Henry Abbott, a writer who was incarcerated almost his whole life for his
crimes, wrote before hanging himself: "As long as I am nothing but a ghost of
the civil dead, I can do nothing…", the 'civil dead' are those, like himself,
who had their autonomy systematically destroyed by the state. Now his words
extend to cover all of us. We have seen our own autonomy being systematically
destroyed by the State. We are becoming ghosts of our dead civil rights.
 
criminals.
So yes we are criminals, we are the criminals our dear system have created:
Argumentum ad Baculum
 
In a world where you fear the words you use to express yourself. Where you are
punished for choosing the wrong ones, we have just decided to follow our own
way. There's no worst kind of slavery than one where you are afraid of your own
thoughts.
 
Governments around the globe are already in control of us in real life, and
they have now declared war on the people to take over the Internet.
It's happening now. It's not waiting for you to wake up.
So now my dear friends, it's your turn to decide where you belong,
and what you are made of.

HOW TO GET THE CANDY ONCE YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THE FILE
 
first check the file MD5:
e7d0984f7bb632ee19d8dda1337e9fba
 
(lol yes, a "1337" there for the lulz, God is in the detail)
 
then decrypt the file using openssl:
openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in file.txt -out decryptedfile.tar.gz
 
password is:
antis3cs5clockTea#579d8c28d34af73fea4354f5386a06a6
 
then uncompress:
tar -xvzf decryptedfile.tar.gz
 
and then check file integrity using the MD5 included in the password u used to
decrypt before:
579d8c28d34af73fea4354f5386a06a6
^ yeah that one.
 
if everything looks fine
then perhaps it is.
 
enjoy it!
 
there you have. 1,000,001 Apple Devices UDIDs linking to their users and their
APNS tokens.
the original file contained around 12,000,000 devices. we decided a million would be
enough to release.
we trimmed out other personal data as, full names, cell numbers, addresses,
zipcodes, etc.
not all devices have the same amount of personal data linked. some devices
contained lot of info.
others no more than zipcodes or almost anything. we left those main columns we
consider enough to help a significant amount of users to look if their devices
are listed there or not. the DevTokens are included for those mobile hackers
who could figure out some use from the dataset.
 
 
file contains details to identify Apple devices.
ordered by:
 
Apple Device UDID, Apple Push Notification Service DevToken, Device Name,
Device Type.
 
 
 
We never liked the concept of UDIDs since the beginning indeed.
Really bad decision from Apple.
fishy thingie.
 
 
so the big question:
why exposing this personal data?
well we have learnt it seems quite clear nobody pays attention if you just come
and say 'hey, FBI is using your device details and info and who the fuck knows
what the hell are they experimenting with that', well sorry, but nobody will care.
FBI will, as usual, deny or ignore this uncomfortable thingie and everybody will
forget the whole thing at amazing speed. so next option, we could have released
mail and a very small extract of the data. some people would eventually pick up
the issue but well, lets be honest, that will be ephemeral too.
So without even being sure if the current choice will guarantee that people
will pay attention to this fucking shouted
'FUCKING FBI IS USING YOUR DEVICE INFO FOR A TRACKING PEOPLE PROJECT OR SOME
SHIT' well at least it seems our best bet, and even in this
case we will probably see their damage control teams going hard lobbying media
with bullshits to discredit this, but well, whatever, at least we tried and
eventually, looking at the massive number of devices concerned, someone should
care about it. Also we think it's the right moment to release this knowing that
Apple is looking for alternatives for those UDID currently and since a while
blocked axx to it, but well, in this case it's too late for those concerned
owners on the list. we always thought it was a really bad idea. that hardware
coded IDs for devices concept should be erradicated from any device on the
market in the future.
 
so now candy was delivered.
few words, and just a few, about how the shit came. we don't like too much
about disclosing this part, we understood it would be needed, so, fuck
whatever. lost asset. Hope it serves for something.
 
 
During the second week of March 2012, a Dell Vostro notebook, used by
Supervisor Special Agent Christopher K. Stangl from FBI Regional Cyber Action
Team and New York FBI Office Evidence Response Team was breached using the
AtomicReferenceArray vulnerability on Java, during the shell session some files
were downloaded from his Desktop folder one of them with the name of
"NCFTA_iOS_devices_intel.csv" turned to be a list of 12,367,232 Apple iOS
devices including Unique Device Identifiers (UDID), user names, name of device,
type of device, Apple Push Notification Service tokens, zipcodes, cellphone
numbers, addresses, etc. the personal details fields referring to people
appears many times empty leaving the whole list incompleted on many parts. no
other file on the same folder makes mention about this list or its purpose.
 
 
 
 
so...penis.
 
 
 
to journalists: no more interviews to anyone till Adrian Chen get featured in
the front page of Gawker, a whole day, with a huge picture of him dressing a
ballet tutu and shoe on the head, no photoshop. yeah, man. like Keith
Alexander. go, go, go.
(and there you ll get your desired pageviews number too) Until that happens,
this whole statement will be the only thing getting out
directly from us. So no tutu, no sources.
 
Our support to Wikileaks and Julian Assange.
 
respect to Tunisian and Egyptian people, keep the good fight. Dont accept new
oppressors in the place of the old ones.
 
To Syrian rebels: If Assad wins he will exterminate all of you till the very
last one, so better go and kill the motherfucker and his
bunch of suckers for once.
 
Support to Pussy Riot: Hang in there, babes! Resistance forever.
 
 
we r sorry mike about what happened to you and princess.
we didnt want to bring you in troubles with the feds
and we ve heard about the reasons leading you to have spoken out to them,
it's sad you ve just hanged around couple of weeks with us
(we vagely understood u felt misplaced),
but looking back to some events, at the end, it was also a good choice for
everyone.
hope u finish understanding it's not about the things we think we have seen.
its always about those things we dont see.
theres always another behind behind the behind.
 
Greetings to all other groups struggling on their daily fight.
Remember that fights between us it's what our adversaries are looking for.
Now this is your time.
