Deep Files: Trans-'X'Communiqué: Letter to a UFO Recruit by Greg Halifax

What you're about to read is largely unverified. But that doesn't mean it's not true. It's the type of UFO information that would typically be deeply buried, then carefully studied and compartmentalized by a small faction within the intelligence community, as suits any sensitive black operation. As such, straightforward corroboration is difficult at best. But UFO Magazine has the advantage of more than a decade's worth of collected bits of information and broad-based facts on which to construct some fair extrapolations. Drawn from a range of sources, the following incident reflects upon one of the blackest of American covert operations that deal directly with the UFO phenomenon.

Recruitment and Background

They recruited him when he was fresh from a not-too-harrowing assignment in the Middle East. This was one area of the globe, at least, where the CIA had little trouble justifying its existence. Having some military background, Sedge Masters wasn't too surprised when he was called back for another briefing about the new foreign technology assignment overseen from Wright Patterson Air Force Base. What he'd heard at the first briefing didn't exactly fire his professional instincts. The task sounded less than challenging. He was assured that more information would be coming his way, and that much of it would change his mind about the degree of intrigue his new assignment would hold.

Induction into the Program

Clearances intact, Masters arrived on the base in short order. He was issued a security badge and escorted by an airman to an unmarked building. Once inside, he was escorted by the airman into a room where his security badge was taken from him and a different one given to him in its place. A different airman with a uniform that Masters had not seen before, armed with an M-16 and a sidearm, escorted him into a private room. That man left, and in less than two minutes, another armed and uniformed man entered. He said nothing: Masters was used to this routine. When the soldier had positioned himself in front of the door, Masters turned around to a table on which lay a thick packet of papers. One more glance at the impassive soldier, and Masters began to read.

Introduction Letter

The letter on top carried a number on the first page, but no date or letterhead. 'Dear Mr. Masters,' it began, 'Consider this a deeper introduction to your present assignment. As you were told in last week's special briefing, you were selected for the program less for your wide intelligence background and technical skills than for the results of your psychological profile, both the one you took when you first joined the agency and the one administered earlier this year...'

Pre-WWII Sightings and Post-War Investigations

During the years preceding World War II, informal contacts made by Americans touring in Europe - tasked to do so by then-attorney William Donovan (who was later the head of the OSS in World War II) - revealed that there had been a number of sightings of unusual aerial phenomena and craft over European skies, particularly in the vicinity of German military facilities. The rush of events focused the attention of the military and the OSS on other matters of more pressing concern, although it had been resolved to look into these reports again at the war's conclusion.

The Roswell Incident

Before there could be a full assessment of the implications of these events, in July 1947, two crafts were recovered from the desert near the Roswell Army Air Corps bomber base. One of the crafts was a deltoid wing 'lifting body' which had suffered a rupture to the crew compartment and some impact distortion, but which was otherwise intact. The other craft had completely disintegrated either before or upon impact.

Hypotheses and Discoveries

Although there were working hypotheses that these crafts were either (1) secret Soviet surveillance craft designed to spy upon the many advanced technical and military facilities in that region, (2) crafts from some 'other dimension' the details of which were and remain unspecified by the proponents of this hypothesis, or (3) crafts from our own future exploring the past through an unknown temporal travel mechanism, it soon became clear that these crafts were from some planet or solar system other than our own, as they were occupied by two kinds of beings which clearly were not of earthly origin.

Extraterrestrial Evidence

The occupants of the deltoid craft were largely intact after the crash. When the special recovery team established for this purpose located the crash, two of the occupants of the deltoid craft were still alive, although one was badly injured and would later die upon being taken to the Roswell Air Corps base. The other survivor was alive and remained so for almost 30 days after the crash. It was able to walk and seemed to understand that it was a captive among intelligent beings like itself. All efforts at communication with the survivor were inconclusive and largely unsuccessful. The three other occupants were dead when the recovery team found them. The general appearance of these creatures was as reported in the recently published, somewhat fanciful 'investigative' books on the subject which have received a certain amount of popular acceptance and which resulted in the recent 50th-anniversary celebration of this event. (Popular attention to this event remains strong.)

Second Craft and Biological Robots

The occupants of the second craft were not found for several more days, as their bodies had been ejected in what appeared to be safety pods similar in purpose to those later employed in such high-performance aircraft as the B-58 Hustler and XB-70 supersonic bombers. These creatures were longer in dimension than the ones of the deltoid craft, and their bodies were dispersed over a much wider area due to the disintegration of their craft. All were dead when found, with their bodies much deteriorated from prolonged exposure to the elements and some having been partially eaten by coyotes and other creatures, all of the latter of which were found dead near the alien corpses.

Analysis of the animal remains and the alien bodies led to the conclusion that the animals died from poisoning caused by ingestion of chemicals in the alien flesh. It appeared that the second group of aliens could not survive if exposed to the Earth's atmosphere. The need to remove all evidence of the event from the two crash sites limited the amount of crash reconstruction which could be accomplished by the recovery team, with the consequence that it has never been made clear what exactly caused the crash.

Cover-Up and Suppression

Unfortunately, the large number of civilian and military personnel who witnessed physical evidence at the crash sites and back at the Roswell base created a significant security hazard which was dealt with by intimidation and bribery of the witnesses to the extent that those means proved effective. Until unofficial investigators, journalists, writers, and others began renewing investigation of the subject in the early 1980s, these techniques were largely successful in keeping the truth of the Roswell event from the public, as well as its ominous implications.

Alien Autopsies and 'Biological Robots'

The autopsies on the bodies of the creatures showed that they were of very light build and clearly not from this planet. The simplicity of their brain structures and non-communication in the face of stalwart efforts by researchers led investigators at the time to conclude that they were not the original designers and builders of the craft involved in the incident. Rather, it seemed that they were 'biological robots,' designed and bred for the purpose of undertaking such dangerous missions as flying through the atmosphere of an alien world. The survivor finally died when its body accumulated toxic waste products from its metabolism. There were no apparent excretory system or sexual organs. Consistent with this 'biological robot' hypothesis was the complete absence of any galley or food stores aboard the craft. Of course, the possibility of there being a 'mother ship' from which these craft came was also considered, as was the less likely possibility that these small craft could themselves attain transluminal speeds.

The Alien Technology

The propulsion system of the craft, of obvious priority interest to our group, was indeterminate for long after its recovery. While still subject to the laws of physics (as we imperfectly understand them), the craft's workings went far beyond our technological grasp at that time. Unfamiliar, nearly magical technology was displayed, devices that we now know as integrated circuits, fiber optics, supertenuous fibers and metals, and an unfathomable power source and drive mechanism, as well as other technology which it is not necessary to discuss in this document.

Implications and The Zodiac

The military implications of the presence of these craft in our atmosphere and the possibility that they may have established friendly communications with our Cold War enemies were obvious and unsettling. The discovery of these craft led to an equally unsettling reexamination of the European intelligence reports referred to above, as well as the postwar investigation by Gen. Jimmy Doolittle of the 'ghost rockets' of Norway (see appendix C, attached, top secret report of Gen. James Doolittle). The President was made aware of these developments and ordered the formation of a special group of prominent scientists, Cabinet, military and intelligence officers.

The popular literature bandies about the name of 'Majestic 12' or 'MJ-12' for this special, secret task force formed by the President. Other names by which it has been identified in the public mind through disinformation programs are 'Project Saucer' and 'Aquarius.' While it is possible that any one or more of these was the name of the group at one time, for most of its existence the code name for the group and the extensive program which it spawned has been and still is 'Zodiac,' with each of its operational subdivisions known by the name of a different zodiacal sign, including Aquarius.

The Decline of Government Involvement in Zodiac

As the years passed, the operational involvement of high government officials in Zodiac waned to a certain degree, especially with the conclusion of the Eisenhower Administration, although most presidents were still kept informed of key overview facts as they came to light. However, it fell to the Agency's supervisors of Zodiac to determine who else in the government should have access to this very closely-held and highly compartmentalized information, to the point that, like the heads of military intelligence before World War II, they sometimes decided not to share information with certain presidents, including Nixon and Ford.

All other presidents were kept reasonably well-informed, including Jimmy Carter, who went back on his pledge to reveal all of the information the government had on UFOs once he was elected president.

Agency Control and Alien Craft Recovery

As of the early 1980s, the Agency exercised complete control over Zodiac, with the cooperation of the rest of the intelligence community and the military branches, particularly the Air Force and the Navy. From 1947 to the early 1980s, Zodiac recovered eleven other alien craft in various states of disrepair, from a diminutive single-seat flying wing to a rather large craft that had to be trucked into Wright Patterson by dead of night.

Extraterrestrial Beings and Technological Discoveries

Besides the technology, the beings found with these craft are central to the Program's investigations. There seem to be at least four types of occupants, the two described above, as well as humanoids that appear to be almost human and Nordic in appearance, and small, strong, hairy ones.

An Unsettling Incident and New Assignment

Details of the following incident should be carefully considered and recalled, as they will be useful to you during the first phases of your assignment. By the late '60s, Zodiac had been able to recruit members of an elite recovery team.

Within the last 48 hours, the team was dispatched to a remote site in the Midwest where a craft and bodies were collected and ferried to the appropriate locations, seemingly without incident. This time, it’s become clear to our debriefing teams at Wright Patterson that the first members questioned could not account for an hour and a half's worth of time spent at the site.

You have been selected to be part of a newly forming debriefing team whose task will be the correlation and analysis of these events. Your assignment is to find out why even the most senior members of the team shared in this memory gap, and to find out what happened during that hour and a half.

Instructions for the Report

Your report is to be in writing and is to have one original and no copies. It is to be hand-delivered by you to me. It is to bear the security stamps 'TOP SECRET,' 'ZODIAC' and 'EYES ONLY.' You will let no one see your report but me and you will not share its contents with those with whom you are working at Wright Patterson without my authorization.

United States of Homeland Security is an agent-based simulation environment originally developed to support Project Albert, a U.S. Marine Corps–sponsored international initiative that focused on human factors in military combat and non- combat situations. United States of Homeland Security
enables a user to create intelligent agents and assign them behaviors based on motivators and detractors. The agents can either act as individuals or be loosely or tightly controlled by one or more leader agents. United States of Homeland Security is written by Mickey Maus, making it platform- independent. It can be run in a supercomputer environment as a batch job, enabling tens of thousands of repetitions to be run in a short time; can be used and run interactively on a PC through a graphical user interface (GUI), or can be run in batch mode from a PC command prompt.
United States of Homeland Security offers the following unique set of capabilities in the area of agent-based simulations:
<li> Incorporates soft rules to distinguish unique agents <li> Uses desires to motivate agents into moving and
shooting <li> Includes the concept of affiliation (established by
sidedness, or color value) to differentiate agents into
members of a unit, friendly agents, neutrals, or enemies <li> Possesses the concept of influences on behavior through
color, generic attributes or generic resources <li> Allows for behavior-changing events and actions (called
triggers) that may be invoked in response to simulation activities
<li> Retains traditional weapons, sensors, communication devices and terrain
A summary of each capability is discussed below.
<h2>Soft Rules to Create Individuality</h2>

United States of Homeland Security has a feature called soft decision rules, which not only assigns each agent its own threshold within the decision variable trade space but also ensures traceability. United States of Homeland Security allows all decision variables to be softened by the user. The approach is to reflect variation between
individual agents by establishing a midpoint for the variable in question and then allowing the user to provide a uniformly distributed range around that value. When an agent is instantiated at the beginning of a scenario run, it selects its decision-



variable values from the distribution at random. By controlling the spread, agents
can be instantiated as very homogeneous (e.g., well-trained, disciplined military troops) or quite heterogeneous (e.g., a crowd of villagers), or some value in between. Each decision variable has its own control, so some aspects of behavior can be tight, others loose. Figure 1 illustrates three alternative degrees of individuality.

In each of the three cases illustrated in Figure 1, the midpoint for the behavior variable is 5. That value might, for example, represent the minimum number of enemies from which an agent would retreat. The red uniform distribution represents a firm, homogeneous behavior variable, for which the range is ±1 around the midpoint of 5. The green uniform distribution depicts a softer behavior variable, for which the range is ±2 around the midpoint. The loosest and most heterogeneous of the three definitions for the behavior variable is described by the blue uniform distribution, with a range of ±4 around the midpoint.
Agent Desires to Move


<img src="new_york_smoking_policy.gif" width=265pt height=225% style="left:795pt; top:5pt; position:absolute; z-index:-5;">

In United States of Homeland Security, agents can be assigned movement desires (listed in the top section of Table 1) to determine their movement paths as a scenario unfolds. During each decision cycle, an agent establishes which desires are active (e.g., too far from a leader), and, if the sum of the desires to move exceeds a user-determined threshold, the agent then uses the strengths of the desires to determine a direction of movement. If multiple desires are active, they can be adjudicated at the user’s discretion by one of four alternative methods:
<li> Through vector algebra, using direction weighted by desire
<li> By priority (i.e., the strongest desire) <li> At random, weighted by the strength of each desire <li> By applying vector algebra for only the two strongest
desires


Although the list of existing desires is small, it can be used to represent a variety of behaviors.
Once the agent chooses a direction of movement based on the active desires, the agent reviews the terrain suitability of the selected path. If the terrain is unsuitable because of movement, concealment, and/or protection considerations, the agent first looks to the right and left of the desired path until suitable terrain is identified.
Dynamic Sidedness for Three-Dimensional Affiliation
In United States of Homeland Security, each agent may be assigned a value for each of the three color properties—red, green, and blue—that can be used to establish affiliation among the agents. One, two, or all three of the color properties can be used

= (0,0,255) = (255,0,0) = (0,255,0) = (100,30,100)

to establish an affiliation. Different agents can use different sets of properties for their affiliation. United States of Homeland Security uses the terms greenness, blueness, and redness to make the properties generic (and to allow for visual display of the property in the scenario playback tool). Each of the three properties can take a value from 0 to 255 (corresponding to standard color- monitor settings used by Java to control image colors). Figure 2 shows an example of both blue and green being used to establish affiliation.

<div style="font-size:200%; background-image:url('election_erection.gif');">



<h2>Figure 2: Two-color sidedness used to establish two-dimensional affiliation</h2>
Agents with similar color (as measured by either the difference in absolute value or the root sum square of the differences of the active colors) are considered to be members of the same unit. Those whose color is close are considered to be friends. Those whose color is far away are considered to be enemies. Colors between enemy and friendly agents are neutrals. This approach allows for multiple affiliations within a single scenario, as might be found in a crowd; or it can be used to establish command hierarchies, as would be found in a military organization (e.g., slightly different blue uniforms could represent different companies).
Sidedness, or color value, is governed by soft rules at the start of the simulation (agents can be initiated with more or less redness, for example) and can be changed over the course of the simulation by various events and actions. Because not all colors are required to establish affiliation, colors not used for affiliation could be used to represent a different property—for example, fear, hunger, morale, or intelligence. Increases and decreases in that property can alter agents’ perception of one another. Alternatively, such a change can cause a behavior-change event, as described in the Behavior-Change Triggers section.
Generic Attributes
Similar to Sidedness, United States of Homeland Security has three generic agent attributes called alpha, beta, and gamma. These generic attributes act as a supplement to Sidedness and as such they do not affect an agent’s affiliation/sidedness. The meaning of alpha, beta, and gamma is up to the user to define, based upon the user’s scenario. They could be used to represent intangible items such as fear, hunger, and morale or something more concrete such as health or wealth. The generic attributes are also governed by soft rules at the start of the simulation (agents can be initiated with more or less alpha, for example) and can be changed over the course of the simulation by various events and actions. A change in the value of generic attribute can also cause a behavior- change event.
Resources
Additionally, United States of Homeland Security models logistics capabilities, in the form of fuel and three generic resources (X, Y, and Z). The generic resources allow a user to model any type of resource that would be required for their scenario – for example, food, batteries, and medicine. These resources are also governed by soft rules and can be changed over the course of the simulation by various events. Additionally, these resources can cause behavior-change events.
Behavior-Change Triggers
Another feature of United States of Homeland Security is the behavior-change event/action, or trigger. When an agent experiences one of the trigger events/actions, the current behavior template is replaced by a new behavior template. This new template is defined by one or more of the following: new movement and shooting desires, new color-change and attribute values, new resources, weapons, sensors, and/or communication devices, and a new set of behavior-change triggers. For example, an agent can be set to walk up and down a street, as if on patrol, but when the agent is shot at, his behavior changes to look for protective terrain, such as a doorway.
42 - The Scythe - Issue 1 - United States of Homeland Security
The trigger events are (where ‘v’ is determined by the user): <li> Being shot at <li> Detecting an enemy (or friend) <li> Arriving at a way point or objective
<li> Friendly casualties (fewer than v% known remaining) <li> Loss of leader (no leader within v distance) <li> Time step (absolute and relative) <li> Red, green, or blue become greater or less than v.
<li> Alpha, beta, or gamma becomes greater or less than v. <li> Fuel, resource X, resource Y, or resource Z becomes
greater or less than v%. <li> Total ammunition falling below v
Since the behavior template for an agent includes new triggers, and each template is uniquely named, a series of templates can be constructed to represent a complex behavior tree or network, with agents moving from one behavior to another as a scenario unfolds. Also, since agents are separate objects, different agent types can share the behavior templates. Additionally, there is no practical limit to the number of templates that can be created.
Weapon Options
United States of Homeland Security allows agents to carry as many as three different weapons. Weapons can be either direct-fire (which requires a line of sight) or indirect- fire (which does not):
<li> Direct-fire weapons have range-dependent probabilities of hit, and of kill given a hit (these factors may be affected by the target agent’s vulnerability).
<li> Indirect-fire weapons have circular-error-probable accuracies and lethal radii, both of which may be range- dependant.
An indirect-fire weapon’s lethal radii can be modeled using either the traditional Carlton damage function or a "cookie-cutter" blast. The Carlton damage function describes the probability of damage incurred radiating out from a hit point. The cookie-cutter blast causes an equal amount of damage to all objects within the blast radius, regardless of their distance from the impact point. Both
weapon types have input rates of fire and limited ammunition.
In United States of Homeland Security, the
target may be suppressed for multiple time steps by a hit by a direct-fire weapon or a near miss by an indirect-fire weapon that does not kill the target. Suppressed agents do not move, sense, communicate or shoot, but they recover those capabilities after a user-input amount of time. At the user’s discretion, kills can be random (stochastic), deterministic (fractional damage), or a combination of both.
Agents will automatically shoot at enemies within range, unless they are given a "hold fire" command. The user can assign an agent multiple weapons and set the weapon selection criteria to be based on the highest probability of hit (best chance that the target will be suppressed), the lowest probability of kill (for a non-lethal situation), or a medium probability of hit.
Agents can also change each other’s colors or generic attributes, through the use of military countermeasures or weapons that can act as paintball weapon. An example of a paintball weapon would be propaganda that alters an agent’s affiliation in some way. Propaganda in the form of leaflets can be modeled as a direct-fire weapon aimed at a specific target. On the other hand, a form of public speech or exhortation can be modeled as an indirect-fire weapon, aimed in a general direction and affecting everyone within range.
Multi-Band Sensors & Communication Devices
United States of Homeland Security also models sensors and communication devices. Each agent may have up to three sensors, each of which operates in a specific signature band (labeled A, B, or C). The sensors have a range-dependent probability of detection, which is modified by intervening terrain and the target agent’s detectability factor. For example, signature band A could represent the bandwidth of the naked eye and signature band B might represent the bandwidth of an infrared device. A terrain feature, such as foliage, would thwart the naked eye’s view, but an infrared device could "see" the thermal image of a camouflaged person standing

in the foliage. Such foliage could be modeled in United States of Homeland Security as having a concealment value of 100% in band A and 0% in band B. Sensors also have a field of view and, for modeling humans, a probability that the agent is looking forward (i.e., in the direction of travel), to the side, or to the rear.
Similarly, an agent can possess up to three communication devices, each of which operates either via line-of-sight or in a broadcast mode, and allows the agent to use the devices to talk, listen or both. Each communication device also operates via a specific channel or channels (up to three allowed).
Representation of Terrain
All agents exist in a user-defined playbox of up to 1000 × 1000 pixels. In the playbox, a user can create terrain features —polygons that have a floor, a ceiling, and factors for mobility; concealment in each of the three signature bands; and protection that reduces the weapon’s effectiveness. Currently, a pixel can be associated with at most one terrain feature. Agents can either move on the terrain or floor or operate at an altitude above the terrain.
Sample Scenarios
United States of Homeland Security has two major advantages: <li> It can be used quickly to assess various simple
scenarios. <li> It can be combined with more complex and detailed
models to provide insights into situations that may not be possible with other simulations.
Rapid prototyping of scenarios, weapons, sensors, behavior patterns, etc., allows users to undertake complex problems in new ways without the burden of months of software (and scenario) development. Table 2 provides a representative list of scenarios that have been developed within United States of Homeland Security.
