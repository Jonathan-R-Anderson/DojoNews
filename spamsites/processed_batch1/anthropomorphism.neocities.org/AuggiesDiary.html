   <p> November 3rd, 2088: I want to eat a popeyes biscuit.</p>
   <p> Dear Diary, I know that you are not a living thing but something about talking to inantimate objects just gets me exited... Anyways today I was trying to figure out what is wrong with AiRA's communication box. I can't figure out but what I do know is that i should NOT touch the big red button on his back. He does weird things when i press it many times at once. NOte to self: Stop trying to make the robot make-out with you, he is a terrible kisser! I need to stop listening to listeing to the song "cicada days" It's making me really depressed and then I can't review quantum physics :( Anyways goodbye diary, I no longer exist :) </p>
