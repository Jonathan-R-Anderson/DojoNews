<p>This is a non-political <strong>manifesto</strong> about
using the web. I like the concept of the indy web, but I don't
subscribe to its assertive and combative stance against the digital
mainstream.</p>
<p>When I was extremely young, the first experience I had with
web development was with GeoCities. With a friend, we created a
one-page website using the WYSIWYG editor that came with Netscape
Communicator. That site was in the Corridor neighborhood of GeoCities'
Area 51 City. Sadly, that website, for a reason that escapes me, didn't
make the cut to any of the GeoCities archives that are still accessible
on the web.</p>
<p>After that, I created various fun projects in other free
hosting services, like Xoom or Tripod. When I was creating those sites
for fun, the finished product didn't feel as fun as the one in
GeoCities, because the concept of neighborhoods and cities was lacking.
But at the same time, it felt good, because the branding on Xoom,
Tripod, and similar services wasn't as intrusive as the one in
GeoCities. That made the sites look a little bit less amateurish.</p>
<p>A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then. I
didn't become a web developer by trade but ended up as an internet
communicator, an occupation that forces you to be a webmaster and a web
designer of sorts. To gear down from the daily grind, and return to
archaic technology with the purpose of creating a vintage static
website was very funny until I realized how difficult were things back
then, and how easy it is now to create a dynamic super website with
only the most basic internet technical skills.</p>
<p>Developing this website from scratch took me around three
weeks, working on it only during the weekends. I think that if you
decide to create a static website like the ones that were common a
quarter-century ago you gain something in the trade-off. You get to do
simple things that have to excel in the content and esthetics
departments since you don't have a lot of functionality to make them
attractive in that sense.</p>
<h2>This Manifesto's Core Values</h2>
<p>Before deciding to publish this website I did a couple of
nights deep diving into what is being called the indy web. I found a
page on Neocities that was a compendium of user manifestos, and I did
read a handful of them.</p>
<p>I thought I would like the concept until I started to notice
that, apparently, it is a movement that mixes culture with politics.
Then I knew that I would never associate myself directly with the indy
web, even if I like the sites those that form part of the movement
create.</p>
<p>I mean, to create a scene that harks back to the old times of
the web is all fine and dandy at the cultural and aesthetic levels,
until you start joining causes and becoming militant about issues that
may not affect you directly.</p>
<p>You always have a choice to do or not do something, use or not
use a product or service, belong or not belong to a social media
community. But I think that to posture by attacking the things that you
don't like is a dumb way of wasting your precious time.</p>
<p>Sincerely, I don't agree with the leftist notion that art must
be politically charged. Whatever happened to art for art's sake? Or art
for the love of beauty, perfection, and aesthetic pleasure? I think
that to think art must have a political angle is just a crutch for
those who aren't that talented to give importance to their otherwise
forgettable output.</p>
<p>Still, I know from where are coming those that feel that web3,
and the social media monopolies are a threat.</p>
<p>Years ago, about 4-5 years ago, I had a season when I became
very indignant about privacy issues on the web. Around 2017 I did not
know about the indy web yet, and the only literature that echoed my
concerns were the things coming out from the Anonymous movement.</p>
<p>I wasn't interested in joining that movement, but I thought
that the points about privacy they made were important and that I had
already become too enmeshed in all the free web services that make you
a product. I vowed to slowly begin to spin out from all of them,
Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. Truth is, around that time when I
stopped working as a technician and became a communicator, I ended up
seeing the monopolies for what they are, just tools that help you to do
the things you need to do.</p>
<p>The issue with monopolies, privacy, and all the evils of
commercialism is not a black or white issue. Yes, I know that they have
questionable aspects. Still, I think that you can manage your
involvement with them and use what you need, without rejecting them
100% as if they were lepers.</p>
<p>Personally, I try to find always the positive side of
everything, while at the same time doing whatever I can to evade the
negatives. You can go a long way by applying this approach to the
things that those in the indy web movement hate. It's about not
rejecting things, but also not letting those things have the upper hand
in your personal life.</p>
<p>For instance, does using Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo Mail worry
you because their AIs scan your mailboxes to dish ads out to you? Then,
if you already have accounts with these services, migrate all your
personal mail out, to more private alternatives, but instead of closing
your accounts, you keep them to receive impersonal things and messages
that you don't need to reply to.</p>
<p>This manifesto will grow with ideas and processes to help
those on the web that would want to have a presence that is freer in
general, and less involved with the common-place websites on the web
that everybody uses.</p>
<h2>Goals of This Website and This Manifesto</h2>
<p>The purpose of this website is to create a place where I can
express my personality. I have other websites, but they are all
community-oriented and customer-centric, and I think it would be bad
form to bring personal topics unrelated to their themes in them.</p>
<p>But wait, Zany Hovel is not just a place that I built so I can
have a place on the web to let my ego soar. No, this website is not
going to be all about myself.</p>
<p>I plan to make it more about things you can do and use to not
depend on the mainstream conception of the web, by taking advantage of
either overlooked or forgotten resources.</p>
<h3>What's in it For You?</h3>
<p>If you use this site and read this manifesto each time it is
updated you will achieve two things:</p>
<p>1) Knowing about me in an in-depth way: The Work, Leisure,
Art, and Personal info pages will serve that purpose.</p>
<p>2) Discovering ways to use the web in a different manner, more
akin to what it was before the big corporations had taken over.</p>
<p><a href="manifesto.html" title="Manifesto for Zany Hovel">This page</a> and the <a href="bholenaths-picks-and-links.html" title="Bholenaths Picks and Links">links section </a>will show the
non-mainstream and non-commercial places on the web that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A) Shouldn't be neglected as
virtual locations to visit, to just have a fun time, learn something
new, or experience bits and pieces of internet history </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B) Are services that can be
leveraged as alternatives to what everyone else uses, that
coincidentally seem to each day be more and more out of favor with
those that proclaim themselves as forming part of the indy web movement.</p>
<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
<p>This manifesto is not set in stone. Is pretty much a work in
progress. I will continue to develop this page with new sections that
will guide you through forgotten back streets of the information
superhighway. Please be sure to either bookmark or subscribe by RSS to
this page, so you will be able to receive notifications when I update
this manifesto.</p>
