            <p><b>Gilded but not gold</b>
            <br>We are eating dinner
            <br>and I can feel him looking at me.
            <br>I can feel him picking and peeling.
            <br>At these things I called bones,
            <br>at this flesh I thought burned.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>With his eyes glowing red, 
            <br>like two hollowed out wine glasses.
            <br><i>May I be excused?</i>
            <br><i>May I be humiliated?</i>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>When it is time,
            <br>when the inner workings, 
            <br>are finally laid out,
            <br>finally laid bare;
            <br>quickly, and hurriedly.
            <br>So as not to scratch the surface,
            <br>So as not to leave a trace.
            <br>I will accept your prognosis,
            <br>delivered over to me on melted words of gold.
            <br>Smelling of roses and chocolate, tasting of acid. 
            <br>there will be no struggle
            <br>on my end. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Because it's no struggle really,
            <br>I only ask one thing of you.
            <br>That you may forget everything.
            <br>Every single word I've ever spoken,
            <br>Every single way I've ever moved
            <br>Every single look I've ever given you.
            <br>Every touch,
            <br>every non-touch,
            <br>every word, or whisper.
            <br>All. Of. It. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Because it is not yours to keep.
            <br>Once you leave, you leave for good. 
            <br>
    
            <br><b>Ship of Theseus</b>
            <br>She is no longer.
            <br>She hasn't been,
            <br>for a while.
            <br>But the skin is the same,
            <br>for the most part. 
            <br>The nose, the mouth,
            <br>the ears, are the same.
            <br>But the way she walks,
            <br>is different. Even she
            <br>knows this, 
            <br>and she sometimes wonders
            <br>if she should even walk at all.
            <br>If it's different now.
            <br>But she's very good at rationalizing,
            <br>at digging, at justifying, 
            <br>it's what she does best;
            <br>So does she it. 
            <br>And now,
            <br>there is nothing left to do,
            <br>but think of Theseus. 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <br><b>Sex</b>
            <br>To surrender.
            <br>To take control.
            <br>To release all inhibition.
            <br>To put everything in its place.
            <br>To write.
            <br>To branch out.
            <br>To branch in, and away.
            <br>To slide over and steal,
            <br>a moment.
            <br>For safekeeping.
            <br>To joke,
            <br>in love's face,
            <br>and say, "See?"
            <br>I can do it.
            <br>I can do it just fine.
            <br>I can bend your rules,
            <br>and lock you away.
            <br>And even though
            <br>you always infiltrate
            <br>you are still always one step behind. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br><b>Like a refuge</b>
            <br>When these things happen,
            <br>and people turn to dust,
            <br>or they wilt, or whatever you may call it.
            <br>There are steps.
            <br>Precautions one must take.
            <br>Step one is to bathe.
            <br>Step two is to bundle.
            <br>Step three is to isolate.
            <br>And step four is different for everyone.
            <br>Maybe you re-integrate,
            <br>maybe you need more time,
            <br>maybe you can't do it by yourself.
            <br>So you start over,
            <br>or split yourself into two,
            <br>so that one of you may hibernate,
            <br>and the other may nurse you back to health.
            <br>Like a sick and dying dog 
            <br>who's been taken in by a nun with a heart of gold.
            <br>But you must be careful,
            <br>because you are not a dog,
            <br>and you are not sick, nor dying.
            <br>And because a heart cannot be made of gold,
            <br>and maybe nuns exist, but because they cannot exist for you.
            </p>
