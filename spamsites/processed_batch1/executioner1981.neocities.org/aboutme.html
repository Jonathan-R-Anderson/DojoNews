    <center><p>So you wanna talk hobbies? I have plenty of those,
    <br>but they come and go as they please for I am forever shifting between a million different versions of myself. 
    <br>Historically, I've been known to surf the web, journal, play guitar, and attempt to code a website. 
    <br>Some new favorites include laying on the floor while listening to music 
    <br>and going out on desperate photo expeditions.  
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I have <s>no</s> plenty of money, no job, and way too many ideas. 
    <br>I fantasize daily about pressing a button capable of (gently, relax) wiping out the entire human race but me. 
    <br>Then I fantasize about what I would do with the whole world to myself; selfish I know, but it's true. 
    <br>Lastly, my dream occupation is a hermit*. </p></center>
