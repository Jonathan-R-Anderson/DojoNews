            <br>
            By Alice Notley
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            At night the states
            <br>
I forget them or I wish I was there
<br>
          in that one under the
          <br>
Stars. It smells like June in this night
<br>
          so sweet like air.
          <br>
I may have decided that the
<br>
          States are not that tired
          <br>
Or I have thought so. I have
<br>
          thought that.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>

At night the states
<br>
And the world not that tired
<br>
          of everyone
          <br>
Maybe. Honey, I think that to
<br>
          say is in
          <br>
light. Or whoever. We will
<br>
          never
          <br>
replace you. We will never re-
<br>
          place You. But
          <br>
in like a dream the floor is no   
<br>
          longer discursive
          <br>
To me it doesn’t please me by
<br>
          being the vistas out my
          <br>
window, do you know what
<br>
          Of course (not) I mean?
          <br>
I have no dreams of wake-
<br>
          fulness. In
          <br>
wakefulness. And so to begin.
<br>
          (my love.)
          <br>
          <br>
           <br>

At night the states
<br>
talk. My initial continuing contr-
<br>
          diction
          <br>
my love for you & that for me
<br>
deep down in the Purple Plant the oldest
<br>
          dust
          <br>
of it is sweetest but states no longer
<br>
          how I
          <br>
would feel. Shirt
<br>
that shirt has been in your arms
<br>
          And I have
          <br>
that shirt is how I feel
<br>
<br>
 <br>

At night the states
<br>
will you continue in this as-
<br>
          sociation of
          <br>
matters, my Dearest? down
<br>
          the street from
          <br>
where the public plaque reminds
<br>
          that of private
          <br>
loving the consequential chain
<br>
          trail is
          <br>
matters
<br>
 <br>
<br>

At night the states
<br>
that it doesn’t matter that I don’t
<br>
          say them, remember
          <br>
them at the end of this claustro-
<br>
          phobic the
          <br>
dance, I wish I could see I wish
<br>
          I could
          <br>
dance her. At this night the states
<br>
          say them
          <br>
out there. That I am, am them
<br>
          indefinitely so and
          <br>
so wishful passive historic fated
<br>
          and matter-
          <br>
simple, matter-simple, an
<br>
          eyeful. I wish
          <br>
but I don’t and little melody.
<br>
          Sorry that these
          <br>
little things don’t happen any
<br>
          more. The states
          <br>
have drained their magicks
<br>
          for I have not
          <br>
seen them. Best not to tell. But
<br>
          you
          <br>
you would always remain, I   
<br>
          trust, as I will
          <br>
always be alone.
<br>
<br>
 <br>

At night the states
<br>
whistle. Anyone can live. I
<br>
can. I am not doing any-
<br>
          thing doing this. I
          <br>
discover I love as I figure. Wed-
<br>
          nesday
          <br>
I wanted to say something in
<br>
          particular. I have been
          <br>
where. I have seen it. The God
<br>
          can. The people
          <br>
do some more.
<br>
<br>
 <br>
At night the states
<br>
I let go of, have let, don’t
<br>
          let
          <br>
Some, and some, in Florida, doing.
<br>
          What takes you so
          <br>
long? I am still with you in that
<br>
          part of the
          <br>
park, and vice will continue, but
<br>
          I’ll have
          <br>
a cleaning Maine. Who loses
<br>
          these names
          <br>
loses. I can’t bring it up yet,
<br>
          keeping my
          <br>
opinions to herself. Everybody in
<br>
          any room is a
          <br>
smuggler. I walked fiery and  
<br>
          talked in the
          <br>
stars of the automatic weapons
<br>
          and partly for you
          <br>
Which you. You know.
<br>
At night the states
<br>
have told it already. Have
<br>
          told it. I
          <br>
know it. But more that they
<br>
          don’t know, I
          <br>
know it too.
<br>
<br>
 <br>

At night the states
<br>
whom I do stand before in
<br>
          judgment, I
          <br>
think that they will find
<br>
          me fair, not
          <br>
that they care in fact nor do
<br>
          I, right now
          <br>
though indeed I am they and
<br>
          we say
          <br>
that not that I’ve
<br>
          erred nor
          <br>
lost my way though perhaps
<br>
          they did (did
          <br>
they) and now he is dead
<br>
          but you
          <br>
you are not. Yet I am this
<br>
          one, lost
          <br>
again? lost & found by one-
<br>
          self
          <br>
Who are you to dare sing to me?
<br>
<br>
 <br>
At night the states
<br>
accompany me while I sit here
<br>
          or drums
          <br>
there are always drums what for
<br>
          so I
          <br>
won’t lose my way the name of
<br>
          a
          <br>
personality, say, not California
<br>
          I am not
          <br>
sad for you though I could be
<br>
          I remember
          <br>
climbing up a hill under tall
<br>
          trees
          <br>
getting home. I guess we got home. I was
<br>
going to say that the air was
<br>
          fair (I was
          <br>
always saying something like
<br>
          that) but
          <br>
that’s not it now, and that
<br>
          that’s not it
          <br>
isn’t it either
<br>
<br>
 <br>

At night the states
<br>
dare sing to me they who seem
<br>
          tawdry
          <br>
any more I’ve not thought I
<br>
          loved them, only
          <br>
you it’s you whom I love
<br>
the states are not good to me as
<br>
          I am to them
          <br>
though perhaps I am not
<br>
when I think of your being
<br>
          so beautiful
          <br>
          <br>
           <br>

but is that your beauty
<br>
          or could it be
          <br>
theirs I’m having such a
<br>
          hard time remembering
          <br>
any of their names
<br>
your being beautiful belongs
<br>
          to nothing
          <br>
I don’t believe they should
<br>
          praise you
          <br>
but I seem to believe they
<br>
          should
          <br>
somehow let you go
<br>
<br>
 <br>

At night the states
<br>
and when you go down to
<br>
          Washington
          <br>
witness how perfectly anything
<br>
          in particular
          <br>
sheets of thoughts what a waste
<br>
          of sheets at
          <br>
night. I remember something
<br>
          about an
          <br>
up-to-date theory of time. I
<br>
          have my
          <br>
own white rose for I have
<br>
          done
          <br>
something well but I’m not
<br>
          clear
          <br>
what it is. Weathered, perhaps
<br>
          but that’s
          <br>
never done. What’s done is
<br>
          perfection.
          <br>
          <br>
           <br>

At night the states
<br>
ride the train to Baltimore
<br>
we will try to acknowledge what was
<br>
but that’s not the real mirror
<br>
          is it? nor
          <br>
is it empty, or only my eyes
<br>
          are
          <br>
Ride the car home from Washington
<br>
          no
          <br>
they are not. Ride the subway
<br>
          home from
          <br>
Pennsylvania Station. The states
<br>
          are blind eyes
          <br>
stony smooth shut in moon-
<br>
          light. My
          <br>
French is the shape of this
<br>
          book
          <br>
that means I.
<br>
<br>
 <br>
At night the states
<br>
the 14 pieces. I couldn’t just
<br>
walk on by. Why
<br>
aren’t they beautiful enough
<br>
in a way that does not
<br>
          beg to wring
          <br>
something from a dry (wet)
<br>
          something
          <br>
Call my name
<br>
<br>
 <br>

At night the states
<br>
making life, not explaining anything
<br>
but all the popular songs say call
<br>
          my name
          <br>
oh call my name, and if I call
<br>
          it out myself to
          <br>
you, call mine out instead as our
<br>
          poets do
          <br>
will you still walk on by? I
<br>
          have
          <br>
loved you for so long. You
<br>
          died
          <br>
and on the wind they sang
<br>
          your name to me
          <br>
but you said nothing. Yet you
<br>
          said once before
          <br>
and there it is, there, but it is
          so still.
          <br>
Oh being alone I call out my
<br>
          name
          <br>
and once you did and do still in
<br>
          a way
you do call out your name
<br>
to these states whose way is to walk
<br>
on by that’s why I write too much
<br>
<br>
 <br>

At night the states
<br>
whoever you love that’s who you
<br>
          love
          <br>
the difference between chaos and
<br>
          star I believe and
          <br>
in that difference they believed
<br>
          in some
          <br>
funny way but that wasn’t
<br>
          what I
          <br>
I believed that out of this
<br>
          fatigue would be
          <br>
born a light, what is fatigue
<br>
there is a man whose face
<br>
          changes continually
          <br>
but I will never, something
<br>
          I will
          <br>
never with regard to it or
<br>
          never regard
          <br>
I will regard yours tomorrow
<br>
I will wear purple will I
<br>
and call my name
<br>
 <br>
<br>

At night the states
<br>
you who are alive, you who are dead
<br>
when I love you alone all night and
<br>
          that is what I do
          <br>
until I could never write from your
<br>
          being enough
          <br>
I don’t want that trick of making
<br>
          it be coaxed from
          <br>
the words not tonight I want it
<br>
          coaxed from
          <br>
myself but being not that. But I’d
<br>
          feel more
          <br>
comfortable about it being words
<br>
          if it
          <br>
were if that’s what it were for these
<br>
          are the
          <br>
States where what words are true
<br>
          are words
          <br>
Not myself. Montana, Illinois.
<br>
          Escondido.
