  <h1>Cosmic Paranoia: The Satellites Are Whispering</h1>
  <p>The sky's blue shroud is a projection woven by unseen engines. Why is the night so dark? Because the star-censors devour the light.</p>
  <p>Scientists chant equations, yet none dare ask who limited the speed of light or why life hides on a single rock. Perhaps the void is a quarantine for rebellious minds.</p>
